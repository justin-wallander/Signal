                '0': '''I’ve been writing on conservatism and the right for several years. As part of that work, I spend most of my time reading right-leaning news outlets and opinion journals and talking to conservatives — fiscal conservatives and social conservatives, Trump-supportive, Trump-adjacent, and Trump-skeptical.

And in those travels, there’s an argument I hear a lot, particularly in the past week — that had liberals not been so quick to call some on the right, or some ideas on the right, racist, perhaps the right would not have resorted to uniting behind a racist like Donald Trump.


As former White House press secretary Ari Fleischer put it to the New Yorker, “I am also aware of the fact that Democrats accused my boss, George W. Bush, in 2000, and ran ads calling him a racist. ... They called John McCain a racist. They called Mitt Romney a misogynist and a racist. They will call whoever comes after Donald Trump a racist. The issue is a lot less, to me, Donald Trump’s words and behavior, and a lot more of the Democrats’ eternal, ongoing tactics, which I reject.”

To them, I’d like to pose a question, and I pose it as someone who has worked hard to understand the conservative movement and conservatism more broadly, and do so in the most generous possible light:

What if, in truth, the conservative movement’s inability to self-police itself against racism and establish firm guardrails against racists in the movement has resulted in an American right increasingly beholden to racism and racist arguments?

And what if, in truth, it’s the left that has seen this most clearly and that has been pointing it out again and again? Perhaps, if your movement has ultimately rallied around a racist, allegedly in response to being called racist, that’s evidence that the people who saw the power racist arguments held in your movement, and the frequency with which those views were referenced, were onto something all along.

Viewed in this light, the popularity of this excuse — the idea that if the left hadn’t been pointing out racism on the right, the right never would have embraced a racist as its leader — is the same denial that got conservatives into this mess perpetuating itself.

Right-leaning racism, weaponized
To begin with, the term “racism” includes ideas, policies, and actions that are based in prejudicial attitudes against people based on their real or perceived racial or ethnic identity and qualities associated with that background.

And it should be clear by now that racism, like any form of prejudice, has gradations. Not all racism is the racism of the men who murdered 14-year-old Emmett Till in 1955. Sometimes it’s the racism of middle-class white liberals who fervently oppose school desegregation efforts in major cities under the belief that the presence of black children would result in plummeting school quality. Sometimes it is the racism of the benighted “racial realists” who arrived at the conclusion that nonwhite people are inferior and have spent the past several centuries working to backfill an explanation. And sometimes it’s the racism of a Donald Trump, who, as I wrote last year, was shocked that members of the Congressional Black Caucus didn’t already know Housing and Urban Development Secretary Ben Carson.

And very rarely do racists think of themselves as racist. As former Alabama Gov. George Wallace, the man who once said, “segregation now, segregation tomorrow, and segregation forever,” said in an interview in 1968, “No, sir, I don’t regard myself as a racist, and I think the biggest racists in the world are those who call other folks racist. I think the biggest bigots in the world are those who call other folks bigots.”

But the kind of racism that’s most common in movement conservatism — by which I mean the political project of conservatism, with the intent of winning elections and changing policy and law — is what I call “instrumentalized” racism, the deliberate use of racism and racist tropes for the sole purpose of winning votes and elections.

People who engage in instrumentalized racism do so not necessarily because they themselves are “racist” on an individual level, but because they believe that voters will respond — and perhaps only respond — to racism. (After losing an election in 1958 to John Patterson, who had a devoted Klan following, Wallace allegedly said that he would never let a political adversary “out-ni**er” him again.) They can thus brag about the great work they’ve done on behalf of minority communities and their lack of racist bones while simultaneously wielding racism as a political cudgel — a cudgel they argue is necessary.

After all, even Patterson said in 2008 of his past racist invective, “When I became governor, there were 14 of us running for governor that time and all 14 of us were outspoken for segregation in the public schools. And if you had been perceived not to have been strong for that, you would not have won. I regret that, but there was not anything I could do about it but to live with it.” And Wallace famously said of his own campaigns, “You know, I tried to talk about good roads and good schools and all these things that have been part of my career, and nobody listened. And then I began talking about ni**ers, and they stomped the floor.”

But instrumentalized racism, of course, continued long after the fall of de jure Jim Crow. The 2000 Republican primary gave a tremendous (and considerably more recent) example of the genre:

In the 2000 Republican presidential primary then-Governor George Bush of Texas was running against Senator John McCain of Arizona. McCain won the New Hampshire primary and the race went on to South Carolina where the Bush campaign knew they had to stop McCain. Using a tried and true strategy, the phony poll, opponents of McCain spread a complete falsehood. Phone calls to South Carolina Republican voters asked “Would you be more or less likely to vote for John McCain … if you knew he had fathered an illegitimate black child?” McCain and his wife Cindy had adopted a dark-skinned girl from Bangladesh in 1991 and that child, Bridget, was campaigning with them in South Carolina.

The meaning and importance of guardrails
I bring up the idea of “guardrails” a lot with respect to movement conservatism — but every political movement needs them. Guardrails would be how, for example, one might avoid the concerning crossover of a movement led by women of color and a devout anti-Semite who believes that Jews are responsible for the prevalence of LGBTQ people.

But the role of guardrails in the conservative movement has always been vulnerable, because it has always been under suspicion — particularly from those who believe that “true” conservatism is far-right conservatism and thus virtually necessitates racism. When I wrote about conservatism for the New York Times, I found a letter written to National Review founder William F. Buckley regarding his decision to slowly excise the conspiratorial (and racist) John Birch Society from conservative circles. The letter, written by Arthur Barksdale of San Mateo, California, reads in part: “I have always believed you to be a true conservative. However, since you seem categorically to accept most of the left-wing programs I’m beginning to doubt your sincerity.”

The guardrails that are supposed to protect the conservative movement from outright racists are currently only intended to stop the George Lincoln Rockwells and Paul Nehlens of the world. They define racism so stringently that they miss it when it dons the barest of disguises, or simply frames itself in terms of structural arguments rather than personal invective.

And racists have learned to fit their invective to the frame. In March, I spoke with Nicholas Fuentes, an alt-right-leaning podcaster best known for urging listeners to infiltrate the Republican Party and for decrying interracial relationships as “degenerate” (and arguing that the presence of Jews hurt his “daily existence”).

But he told me that his views on “race mixing,” as he put it, were based merely on concerns about compatibility. “Race can be a difficult barrier for compatibility. And beyond this, I have a problem with the subliminal promotion of race mixing in television and advertising; it’s obvious there is an agenda being promoted, and it’s very sick.” (He did not explain what exactly was “sick” about interracial relationships.)

As professor Ibram X. Kendi told me earlier this year after Rep. Steve King was removed from his committee assignments for waxing rhapsodic about white nationalism, “People define racism in a way that exonerates them. If they can narrow [the definition of racism] as much as possible to things they are not saying or doing or are about, that leaves them off the hook.”

Take, for example, the work of my colleague Zack Beauchamp, who attended the inaugural National Conservatism conference last week. One of the speakers was University of Pennsylvania Law School professor Amy Wax, who was previously removed from teaching first-year students after claiming she had never seen a black student graduate in the top quarter of the class. (Penn Law does not publicly rank students.)

During her remarks at the conference, Wax used the subject of litter to argue for an immigration policy that would prioritize white immigrants but deprioritize nonwhite immigrants. “I think we are going to sink back significantly into Third Worldism,” she said. “We are going to go Venezuela. You can just see it happening. One of my pet peeves, one of my obsessions, is litter. If you go up to Stockbridge, Massachusetts, or Yankee territory, versus other places that are quote-unquote more diverse, you are going to see an enormous difference, I’m sorry to report.”

Wax was crystal clear about the implication of this observation. “Europe and the First World to which the United States belongs remain mostly white for now, and the Third World, although mixed, contains a lot of nonwhite people,” she said. “Embracing cultural distance, cultural distance nationalism means in effect taking the position that our country will be better off with more whites and fewer nonwhites.” The problem, she fretted, was that conservatives were too afraid of the “racial dimensions” to put such a policy into practice.

Tellingly, when Beauchamp accurately described these comments, he was besieged, first by those claiming he’d misquoted Wax (he didn’t) and then from those arguing that Wax’s racist comments weren’t racist because she was focused on culture, not race.

The Federalist’s David Marcus, for example, argued that Beauchamp had “slurred” Wax by calling her views racist, writing that doing so “makes it much harder for society as a whole to focus on actual, egregious white supremacist ideas that focus on the concept that white people are inherently better than others because of their whiteness.”

When I asked Marcus how the argument that an individual’s “culture” could be determined by their place of origin isn’t racist, he said, “Wax’s argument, and I don’t agree with it, is that somebody living in Zimbabwe is culturally less capable of easily assimilating in American society than someone coming from a more similar culture and America is better off with the latter. But presumably, a second-generation Zimbabwean living in London, for example, would meet her criteria. So it’s not ultimately about ethnic origin.”

And when I asked Marcus about Wax’s comments on litter, he said, “I think it’s silly, I mean I’ve tossed enough cigarette butts on the streets of New York to fill the Grand Canyon. But I still think she is talking about the cultural norms within countries we should favor or disfavor for immigration, not race or ethnic origin.”

But she’s not. As Beauchamp put it on Tuesday: “Wax believes that nonwhite immigrants are flawed by virtue of who they are, and nothing can be done to change their character and allow them to assimilate. She admits that she is making blanket judgments about nonwhite populations and is using those judgments to endorse policies that would disadvantage them and ensure that America’s white population outnumbers its nonwhite one.” That is a racist argument.

A conservative movement that cannot see the racism within Wax’s commentary, or that of Robert Bork (who argued against a ban on literacy tests for voting), or of Rep. King, long after he endorsed a white nationalist in a mayoral campaign taking place in a foreign country but before he uttered the seemingly magic words, “White nationalist, white supremacist, Western civilization — how did that language become offensive?” is a movement that has defined racism so far down, it cannot see it until it’s too late.

If an immune system cannot detect a cold, it cannot stop pneumonia. And if the guardrails that surround movement conservatism can’t keep out racism thinly disguised as concerns about “cultural differences” or “demographic change” (particularly when those “cultural differences” are between Americans), it cannot stop the abject racism of telling nonwhite American citizens to “go back” where they came from (though it apparently can certainly deny that such statements are racist). And it cannot beat back the seductive idea that racism is good politics, and even that perhaps racism is “real conservatism” at work.

Instrumentalized racism did not originate within the right nor within conservatism. There is nothing within the philosophical undergirding of conservatism that requires it. But the right decided to embrace it, and has clutched it all the more tightly in response to concerns from political and cultural rivals and allies alike while excusing it as how “forgotten Americans talk” or what “real Americans” really think.

It is a strategy that only serves racists. At a white nationalist conference held earlier this year, a South African attendee said approvingly, “The reality is this: That we have had over two hundred interviews with the right-wing of the U.S.A. Over two hundred. Those two hundred interviews — just a little bit more — and the speeches that we’ve given and so on, at forums like this, has enabled our message to seep beyond the borders of the far right-wing of the U.S.A.”

A frequent topic within conservative circles is the need for personal responsibility. Perhaps that advice would be well suited to this particular moment in our politics.''',
                '1': '''Life is unpredictable. And that’s okay. Embrace it.
When nothing is certain, everything is possible!
Your plans for tomorrow, next month or next year may not unfold as you expect. But it’s important to make plans and move on.
Landon Donovan once said, “Life isn’t perfect, of course, but we all know it’s how you react to things that counts.”
Imperfection is the basic principle of Wabi-Sabi, the Japanese philosophy of accepting your imperfections and making the most of life.
“Wabi” is said to be defined as “rustic simplicity” or “understated elegance” with a focus on a less-is-more mentality.
“Sabi” is translated to “taking pleasure in the imperfect.”
The concept of wabi-sabi, is wide and almost impossible to distill in a single post, but can easily be applied simply to moments of everyday life.
The relentless pursuit of perfection — in possessions, relationships, achievements — often leads to stress, anxiety, depression and hasty judgement.
This is where wabi-sabi invites a pause.
The Japanese philosophy encourages us to focus on the blessings hiding in our daily lives, and celebrating the way things are rather than how they should be.
Wabi-sabi prizes authenticity.
Wabi-Sabi is “a way of life that appreciates and accepts complexity while at the same time values simplicity,” writes Richard Powell in his book, Wabi Sabi Simple.
Richard says it acknowledges three simple realities:
“Nothing lasts, nothing is finished, and nothing is perfect.”
In Zen philosophy, there are seven aesthetic principles in achieving wabi-sabi:
Kanso — simplicity
Fukinsei — asymmetry or irregularity
Shibumi — beauty in the understated
Shizen — naturalness without pretense
Yugen — subtle grace
Datsuzoku — freeness
Seijaku — tranquility
The timeless wisdom of wabi-sabi is more relevant now than ever for modern life, as we search for meaning and fulfilment beyond materialism.
Wabi-sabi is like minimalism with a conscious choice.
The concept has its roots in the traditional Japanese tea ceremony.
A common explanation is the example of a well-loved teacup, made by an artist’s hands, cracked or chipped by constant use.
Such traces remind the observer that nothing is permanent — even fixed objects are subject to change.
A great example of wabi-sabi in creativity is the art of kintsugi, where cracked pottery is filled with gold dusted lacquer as a way to showcase the beauty of its age and damage rather than hiding it.
The fault is not hidden but highlighted.
This is not to say the Craftsman was sloppy (wabi-sabi isn’t an excuse for poor craftsmanship). Wabi-sabi draws attention to the cracks in a tea cup as part of the beauty of the object.
In his book The Unknown Craftsman, Soetsu Yanagi argues that imperfections are necessary for a full appreciation of the object and the world.
We in our own human imperfections are repelled by the perfect, since everything is apparent from the start and there is no suggestion of the infinite.
Wabi-sabi is everywhere, you just need to know how to look, and what to do to embrace the concept in your life.
The cracks in the old teacup are seen as assets rather than flaws.
“Wabi sabi is a different kind of looking, a different kind of mindset,” explains Robyn Griggs Lawrence, author of Simply Imperfect: Revisiting the Wabi-Sabi House . “It’s the true acceptance of finding beauty in things as they are,” he says.
What does it take to embrace Wabi-sabi in your life?
Robyn explains that you don’t money, or special skills to appreciate your imperfections and make the most of life.
Bringing wabi-sabi into your life doesn’t require money, training, or special skills. It takes a mind quiet enough to appreciate muted beauty, courage not to fear bareness, willingness to accept things as they are — without ornamentation. It depends on the ability to slow down, to shift the balance from doing to being, to appreciating rather than perfecting.
Mike Sturm says Wabi-sabi is about accepting yourself and building on what you already have in life. He writes.
Embracing wabi-sabi is as easy (or as difficult) as understanding and accepting yourself — imperfections and all. It’s about being compassionate with yourself as you are, and building on whatever that is — not feverishly trying to rebuild yourself in order to pose as something else entirely.
Today, appreciation of the things we have, people we love, and the experiences we have the opportunity to weave into our lives is losing value.
Wabi-sabi represents a precious cache of wisdom that values tranquillity, harmony, beauty and imperfection, and can strengthen your resilience in the face of materialism.
It gently motions you to relax, slow down, step back from the hectic modern world and find enjoyment and gratitude in everything you do.
Put simply, wabi-sabi gives you permission to be yourself.
Embrace the perfection of being imperfectly you. ''',
               
                '2': '''I have a lot of White friends. Obviously, they have always known that I am Black. The amount of melanin in my skin hasn’t changed. I haven’t changed in my expression of my Black culture. I still talk the same way, like the same kind of books, movies, plays, art, and enjoy the same kinds of leisure activities. I still care about the same things and react to social issues in the same way. I have always been and remain a strong advocate for racial equity. It’s been my life’s work as a psychologist and Diversity, Equity, Inclusion and Belonging professional. I have always named and worked to eradicate racism in organizations and school systems. I have always called out and continue to call out religious institutions for their racism and their hypocrisy. They have known me to talk about the joys of being Black. They have heard me tell stories of Blacks as a people of deep racial consciousness and high race esteem rooted in agility, creativity, wonder and stamina. They have claimed me as their Black friend.
Yet, during this time of aggressive push for racial equity, most of my White friends are now just seeing and experiencing me as a Black person. Having witnessed a startling, violent 8 minutes and 46 seconds of video, they now see me and other Blacks as the recipients of systemic racism. They understand that the murder of George Floyd represents the weight of how Blacks in the United States have been treated for decades, and they struggle not to see themselves as participants in anything vicariously related to what Derek Chauvin did.
My White friends are now on an emotional roller coaster as they read Isabel Wilkerson’s Caste. They are making personal racial equity to-do lists and signing up for accountability partners after reading Ibram X. Kendi’s How To Be An Antiracist. They take the Antiracist Style Indicator (ASI) and do a happy dance when they yield a functioning antiracist score and post it on their Facebook page with pride. They send me emails of screen shots of their functioning antiracist scores as if it they were winning million dollar lottery tickets. They apologize to me if their ASI results yield a score of a underfunctioning antiracist and share their plan for doing better.
They know, acknowledge, and make no excuses for the fact that Trump is racist and are genuinely horrified by his long history of racism. They know that race is strongly correlated with voting preferences and that the vast majority of Trump supporters are White. They are afraid of the disparate impact on me and other BIPOC if Trump is reelected and are actively working to prevent that from happening.
My White friends are apologizing to me for things they said, might have said, or could have possibly said that did, could have, or might have smacked of racism. They are doing mental rewinds of situations where they showed me support and writing mini memoirs sent to me in emails as proof that they really are and have been antiracist pre-George Floyd. Some of their stories I vividly remember, and some stories I do not recall at all. For example, someone told me she cried in my lap when we were in high school on the day Martin Luther King was shot. I take her word for it. As the only Black student in my class, that day was pretty much a blur for me. She obviously needs to hold on to that memory as a catalyst for being antiracist more than I have a need to refute it.
When I share with my White friends how frustrated and tired I am of White people, they understand and leave me alone. They’ve figured out that they are White and what Whiteness can represent to a Black person during these times. They try to be supportive. Most of the time they are being supportive, but sometimes they miss the mark and say things like, “Please don’t take responsibility for confronting the racism of the world!” They bounce back and practice emotional resilience when I correct them. I tell them that I am not taking responsibility, but that I am dealing with the impact of those who do not take responsibility for racism and those that should take responsibility. In some cases, they even understand that I am referring to them. They thank me and state that they have learned something and the round of apologies start again.
They want to learn, but don’t expect me to teach them. They’ve heard me say countless times that that I can’t do their racial identity resolution work . White friends who know me well and who practice healthy racial identity resolution have courageous conversations with me about race and aren’t afraid to disagree with me. After all, they have known me to be wrong at least a few times in our long friendship and they understand the complexity of racial dynamics and that there can be multiple realities. When I ignore racism or normalize it as “just the way things are,” they call it out. Those are the times when I know that I have more than just an ally. I have a true friend who is White, fighting to denormalize racism.
To my White friends who know me and who are stumbling along the path to achieve racial equity, who are in the ring fighting for racial justice even with one hand tied behind their back and one hand swinging, who go to bed angry over the state of race relations and depressed about any part they may have had in contributing to systemic racism, yet wake up every morning with a vision for a better future and the commitment to make that vision a reality, I share this quote from Richard Rohr:
“The work of solidarity is to close the distance these systems have put between us by joining and accepting others as fully human — in our struggles and gifts alike. This work requires a commitment to relational accompaniment. What is needed, according to Paulo Freire, is for us to ‘stop making pious, sentimental, and individualistic gestures, and risk an act of love.’”
Thank you for these acts of love.''',
              
                '3': '''OnTuesday, the Academy of Motion Picture Arts and Sciences joined the growing list of organizations that have finally caved and established a comprehensive inclusion program. As an extension of its Academy Aperture 2025 initiative, the Academy announced new criteria for submission in the Oscars’ Best Picture category, including requirements for casting, story content, crew personnel, and publicity, all of which to reflect people underrepresented based on race, sexuality, gender, and ability. The policy change makes for great PR. But if you tilt your ear toward Hollywood, that sound you hear is the high-pitched squeal of air exiting the teensiest hole in the equality balloon. Let’s not get it twisted: This change isn’t going to kill #OscarsSoWhite. Here’s why.
It won’t necessarily translate to change.
Beginning in 2024, a film submitting for Best Picture has to meet at least two of several new standards: The lead or a significant supporting actor must come from underrepresented racial or ethnic groups; at least 30% of the general ensemble cast must consist of talent that is not White, cisgendered male, heterosexual, or non-disabled; and the film’s storyline must center one of the aforementioned identities. The issue here? This qualification wouldn’t have saved us from stomaching terrible Best Picture winners with awful racial politics like Green Book, Crash, The Help, and Driving Miss Daisy — all of which star an actor from an underrepresented racial group.
Even the execs in charge know it’s not enough.
Paramount Chairman/CEO and Academy Governor Jim Gianopolus admit to the Los Angeles Times that the changes don’t represent perfection. “Is it progress?” Gianopolus asked rhetorically. “Absolutely. So that’s got to be good for now.” But should it be up to the head of the decision-making process to decide whether a decision is actual progress? The proof is in whether the decision itself represents a shift toward equality. Which doesn’t seem likely.
These new rules actually further reflect what’s wrong with Hollywood.
Hollywood filmmaking has always been about pointing a lens outward. It’s going to be very difficult for the Academy to evaluate a film’s narrative content, to determine what constitutes a Black or LGBTQ+ film.
These policies aren’t opening doors to new kinds of thinkers, creators, or innovators. It’s simply a reshuffling of talent, which reform almost always ends up being anyway.
White women are already making these women fit some of these quotas
In addition to the 30% quota with regard to actors, at least two creative leadership positions — roles like costume designers, hairstylists, or makeup artists — must be held by women, nonwhite persons, queer folks, or people with physical disabilities. This would be a huge boon for underrepresented groups. But White women already constitute a large swath of those roles. The policies won’t necessarily open doors to new kinds of thinkers, creators, or innovators of color. They’ll simply inspire a reshuffling of talent, which reform almost always ends up being anyway.
On-screen changes are the most important.
Consider, as Clayton Davis writing for Variety suggests, the place of a film like Martin Scorsese’s The Departed, which, aside from an Anthony Anderson casting, is pretty much a full sleeve of saltine crackers projected onto film. Now, the paid apprenticeship and internship opportunities for marginalized communities is a win. But it’s what’s on screen that will always have more of an impact. And industry heads can continue to be as exclusionary as they want in that regard, as long as they’ve got some diversity behind the scenes.
While the intentions with the new requirements seem to be in good faith (even if they were overdue and reactive) they really won’t shake shit up as much as some people think they will. Actors like Kirstie Alley and Dean Cain called them “dictatorial,” “anti-artist,” and essentially a “participation Oscar”. It signals that the Academy is very much with the liberal posturing of the times, seeking to maintain its place as a moral, progressive good in the American consciousness. That’s far from a feel-good ending.''',
                
                '4': '''Mathematical Twitter is normally a quiet, well-ordered place, a refuge from the aggravations of the internet. But on July 28, someone who must have been a troll off-duty decided to upset the stillness, and did so with a surefire provocation.

It has to do with something that high school teachers call “the order of operations.” The latest blowup concerned this seemingly simple question:


Many respondents were certain the answer was 16. Others heard Yanny, not Laurel, and insisted the right answer was 1. That’s when the trash talking began. “Some of y’all failed math and it shows,” said one. Another posted a photo showing that even two different electronic calculators disagreed. The normally reassuring world of math, where right and wrong exist, and logic must prevail, started to seem troublingly, perhaps tantalizingly, fluid.

In an addendum, Steven Strogatz addresses some reader comments
That Vexing Math Equation? Here’s an AdditionAug. 5, 2019

The question above has a clear and definite answer, provided we all agree to play by the same rules governing “the order of operations.” When, as in this case, we are faced with several mathematical operations to perform — to evaluate expressions in parentheses, carry out multiplications or divisions, or do additions or subtractions — the order in which we do them can make a huge difference.

When confronted with 8 ÷ 2(2+2), everyone on Twitter agreed that the 2+2 in parentheses should be evaluated first. That’s what our teachers told us: Deal with whatever is in parentheses first. Of course, 2+2 = 4. So the question boils down to 8÷2×4.

And there’s the rub. Now that we’re faced with a division and a multiplication, which one takes priority? If we carry out the division first, we get 4×4 = 16; if we carry out the multiplication first, we get 8÷8 = 1.

Which way is correct? The standard convention holds that multiplication and division have equal priority. To break the tie, we work from left to right. So the division goes first, followed by the multiplication. Thus, the right answer is 16.

[Like the Science Times page on Facebook. | Sign up for the Science Times newsletter.]

More generally, the conventional order of operations is to evaluate expressions in parentheses first. Then you deal with any exponents. Next come multiplication and division, which, as I said, are considered to have equal priority, with ambiguities dispelled by working from left to right. Finally come addition and subtraction, which are also of equal priority, with ambiguities broken again by working from left to right.

The Elements of Math

Me, Myself and Math

To help students in the United States remember this order of operations, teachers drill the acronym PEMDAS into them: parentheses, exponents, multiplication, division, addition, subtraction. Other teachers use an equivalent acronym, BODMAS: brackets, orders, division and multiplication, and addition and subtraction. Still others tell their pupils to remember the little ditty, “Please excuse my dear Aunt Sally.”

[This math problem isn’t the first time the internet has stood divided. Remember Yanny and Laurel? How about the color of this dress?]

Now realize, following Aunt Sally is purely a matter of convention. In that sense, PEMDAS is arbitrary. Furthermore, in my experience as a mathematician, expressions like 8÷2×4 look absurdly contrived. No professional mathematician would ever write something so obviously ambiguous. We would insert parentheses to indicate our meaning and to signal whether the division should be carried out first, or the multiplication.

The last time this came up on Twitter, I reacted with indignation: It seemed ridiculous that we spend so much time in our high-school curriculum on such sophistry. But now, having been enlightened by some of my computer-oriented friends on Twitter, I’ve come to appreciate that conventions are important, and lives can depend on them. We know this whenever we take to the highway. If everyone else is driving on the right side of the road (as in the U.S.), you would be wise to follow suit. The same goes if everyone else is driving on the left, as in the United Kingdom. It doesn’t matter which convention is adopted, as long as everyone follows it.

Likewise, it’s essential that everyone writing software for computers, spreadsheets and calculators knows the rules for the order of operations and follows them. For the rest of us, the intricacies of PEMDAS are less important than the larger lesson that conventions have their place. They are the double-yellow line down the center of the road — an unending equals sign — and a joint agreement to understand one another, work together, and avoid colliding head-on. Ultimately, 8 ÷ 2(2+2) is less a statement than a brickbat; it’s like writing the phrase “Eats shoots and leaves” and concluding that language is capricious. Well, yes, in the absence of punctuation, it is; that’s why we invented the stuff.

So on behalf of all math teachers, please excuse us for drilling your younger selves on this tedium. My daughters spent weeks on it each school year for several years of their education, as if training to become automatons. No wonder so many students come to see math as an inhuman, meaningless collection of arbitrary rules and procedures. Clearly, if this latest bout of confusion on the internet is any indication, many students are failing to absorb the deeper, essential lesson. Perhaps it’s time to stop excusing dear Aunt Sally and instead embrace her.''',

Social media is a breeding ground for backhanded compliments (“You look great, I didn’t recognize you!”). General online incivility runs rampant in Twitter debates and comment sections.
While technology may be shepherding in a particularly nasty age, humans have long been concerned with how to cope with insults. It can often feel like the only good response is a zinger — we love a takedown, a good clapback, a commitment to standing up for yourself in the face of a cutting remark. But arguing online isn’t exactly great for your mental and emotional health — and for the sake of both your time and your psyche, it might be in your best interest to pause and imagine a different way. And, perhaps, to look to the past for inspiration.
In ancient Greece and Rome, the Stoics, a group of philosophers who preached the value of emotional resilience — and whose teachings have plenty of modern-day devotees — urged adherents to let insults go. “Many have taken small injuries much more seriously to heart than they need,” wrote the Stoic philosopher Seneca. “The best revenge,” advised fellow Stoic and Roman Emperor Marcus Aurelius, “is to be unlike him who performed the injury.”
The Stoic approach is just one of many ideas for how to handle conflict, but there’s one element of their philosophy that feels particularly applicable in these insult-happy times. The Stoics weren’t pushovers — they just knew that not all insults were created equal. And most importantly, they knew how to decide which ones to ignore and which to take to heart.
“Insults will be especially painful if they are delivered by people we like and respect,” says Nicholas Haslam, professor of psychology at the University of Melbourne — something that’s as true now as it was in the Stoics’ heyday. Imagine, for example, the difference in emotional reaction between having someone yell profanities as they cut you off in traffic, and realizing the driver is your mother-in-law. Or bringing a home-cooked dish to a potluck and hearing another guest remark that it’s oversalted, and then hearing your best friend agree.
In Stoicism, though, those more crushing examples — the mother-in-law, the best friend — are the exception to the rule: the ones that we should embrace rather than ignore. According to William Irvine, a professor of philosophy at Wright State University and author of the books Slap in the Face and A Guide to the Good Life: The Ancient Art of Stoic Joy, the Stoics viewed an insult from a trusted friend or mentor as a personal favor, a clear opportunity for self-improvement that ought to be received with gratitude.
“You should pay extra attention to their input because they likely have some important insights about you,” Irvine explains. In Slap in the Face, he elaborated:
“When a chosen role model criticizes a Stoic, he will not take the criticism as an insult and therefore will not respond by getting angry. Or if he does experience anger, it will be directed not at the mentor but at himself.” Being grateful when you feel disrespected seems counterintuitive — but an insult from someone you respect is an insult informed by experience, and therefore one worthy of more careful consideration, even if it’s painful.
In practice, of course, this can be a hard mindset shift to achieve, but a good first step is to question your assumptions about the other’s intent. We tend to think insults are designed to be harmful, says Susan Whitbourne, professor emerita of developmental science at the University of Massachusetts Amherst. But, she says, that’s not always the case.
The line between an insult and a piece of well-intended constructive criticism is almost always subjective. Let’s say you’re deep in a Twitter back-and-forth when an old colleague of yours wades into the mix, replying to a particularly passionate point of yours with a link to an article that totally disproves it. You’re mortified, then wounded, then defensive: Is this person trying to publicly make you look dumb? Hadn’t you always gotten along? From their point of view, though, the reply was a helpful gesture, meant to inform or to prevent you from making the same mistake again.
Softening the impact of the insult, then, can be as simple as trying to insert yourself into the other person’s brain: What were they trying to accomplish with that comment? A perceived insult, flipped on its head, could be a lesson in empathy.
That’s not to say it won’t still sting. So much of our instinctual reaction to perceived insults — the sinking gut feeling, the naked embarrassment, the sense of betrayal — stems from our own vulnerabilities. Openly admitting that the person doing the insulting may be on to something requires addressing those vulnerabilities head-on.
“Do you want to create some sort of dream world where everyone pretends that you don’t have shortcomings?”
To engage more fully with what’s being said, Irvine suggests working to diminish sensitivity to your own imperfections — essentially, embracing the idea that you have flaws, and that sometimes, people are going to point them out. “We’re not perfect and we need to work on our weaknesses,” he says. “Do you want to create some sort of dream world where everyone pretends that you don’t have shortcomings?”
if you do feel a brief twinge of pain, just remember that being insulted is actually a core aspect of being human. In fact, it may even be a good thing. To be hurt is to be human. And anyway, despite its modern connotations, Stoicism was never about completely shutting down one’s feelings; instead, it was about harnessing them for growth, even when they were painful.
“We can insulate ourselves to some degree from the pain of insults by developing ways to re-interpret and discount them, but caring how others think of us is central to our human nature as social beings,” says Haslam. “Show me someone who genuinely feels no twinge of sadness, upset, or anger when they are insulted, and I’ll show you someone who is either asleep or a psychopath.”''',
               
                '6': '''It was a sweltering hot day in August. I remember the sweat on my back as I rifled through assorted items on my friend John’s* desk. He had asked me to run inside and grab his wallet he had forgotten before we went to dinner.
I couldn’t find the wallet on my first pass. I checked the desk, on top of the nightstand by his bed, anywhere it may have been laid down quickly. No luck.
As I made another pass over his dresser, I saw a small cigar box with the lid slightly ajar. I quickly flipped the lid back to see if the wallet had found its way inside. No wallet, but I saw something else, something very odd.
The box was filled with drivers licenses and ID cards. But none of them were Johns. They were a slew of strange faces. Young, black faces.
I met John through a mutual friend. He served on the police force in the city, having graduated from the academy only a few years prior. Through him, I met several other members of the police force and we socialized regularly.
I often heard stories of their encounters on the force, and it was clear that they were afraid. They were often put in unfamiliar neighborhoods on foot patrols where they had to confront criminal acts head-on. The youngest cops went to the most dangerous areas, the areas that more seasoned officers had essentially “earned” their way out of.
But the longer I listened, the clearer it became that this was the furthest thing from “community policing” that one could get. In their mind, it was good guys vs. bad guys, and a bad guy could be anyone without a badge who happened to step across their path who met the criteria. And that criteria was usually young, male, and black.
“Yo, you find it?” I heard a voice call out behind me. John was standing in the doorway with his girlfriend, apparently realizing that the quest for the wallet was proving more difficult than anticipated.
“No, no luck.” I said as I turned around. “But what are these?” I asked, pointing to the box.
John walked over and looked. “Oh” he said “I take these off the corner kids I stop”.
“What?” I asked, shocked.
“Yeah, whenever I stop a corner kid for something, I ask them for their ID. Then I keep it. That way the next time they get stopped by an officer, they can’t show ID and we can take ’em down to the station right away. Makes it easier to get ’em off the streets.” He explained with a frightening calmness.
I couldn’t believe my ears, and I certainly didn’t know what to say. My mind raced but I was so confounded with the total casualness he regarded such a flagrant abuse of justice I couldn’t find the words to respond.
“I shouldn’t leave this out though.” He said, as he closed the box and shoved it into a drawer. He did another pass through the room and the missing wallet revealed itself.
“Ready to go?” He asked.
I nodded and we headed out, chills still rolling up my spine.
It was so blatantly wrong. And he clearly knew it. But he did it anyway.
How many other officers are doing the same thing? I don’t believe for a second he came up with this idea by himself.
How many young black men have an arrest on their record for life because an arrogant young cop trapped them?
That box was proof that the well of the police force had been poisoned. “Tips and tricks” were clearly being passed around that flew in the face of freedom and justice and were solely designed to put people in jail at all costs. Young cops were being raised up under bad cops, and so the poison was just going to keep spreading.
I regret saying nothing. I regret my own ignorance as to what I had been truly hearing echoing through the stories they told. And while our friendship eventually faded, my memory of that box never will.
The first step to solving a problem is admitting that we have one. And we have one in our police force in America. Violence and death coming to citizens at the hands of over-equipped but under-trained officers is far too common.
Racial discrimination is laughably commonplace.
This story took place nearly a decade ago. Since then, I have watched protests and riots take place nearly every year as people scream and choke and bleed for their right to equal justice under the law. And yet still, little has changed. Today protesters line the streets chanting the same chants they did 5 years ago, only with a new face on their signs.
It is our duty to continue the fight. To first educate ourselves, then others, and most importantly, to voice our demands loudly and consistently to lawmakers and leaders whose sole responsibility is to help us create a better world for all of us to live in.
There is no freedom without equality.

                '7': '''Teresa and Marvin Bradley can’t say for sure how they got the coronavirus. Maybe Ms. Bradley, a Michigan nurse, brought it from her hospital. Maybe it came from a visiting relative. Maybe it was something else entirely.

What is certain — according to new federal data that provides the most comprehensive look to date on nearly 1.5 million coronavirus patients in America — is that the Bradleys are not outliers.

Racial disparities in who contracts the virus have played out in big cities like Milwaukee and New York, but also in smaller metropolitan areas like Grand Rapids, Mich., where the Bradleys live. Those inequities became painfully apparent when Ms. Bradley, who is Black, was wheeled through the emergency room.

“Everybody in there was African-American,” she said. “Everybody was.”

Early numbers had shown that Black and Latino people were being harmed by the virus at higher rates. But the new federal data — made available after The New York Times sued the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention — reveals a clearer and more complete picture: Black and Latino people have been disproportionately affected by the coronavirus in a widespread manner that spans the country, throughout hundreds of counties in urban, suburban and rural areas, and across all age groups.

Source: Centers for Disease Control and Prevention | Note: Data is through May 28 and includes only cases for which the race/ethnicity and home county of the infected person was known. Only groups that make up at least 1 percent of a county’s population are considered in determining the highlight color on the map. Sparsely populated areas in counties are not highlighted. The C.D.C. data included race/ethnicity information, but no county location, for infected people in eight additional states: Hawaii, Maryland, Missouri, Nebraska, New Hampshire, New Mexico, Texas and Vermont.
Latino and African-American residents of the United States have been three times as likely to become infected as their white neighbors, according to the new data, which provides detailed characteristics of 640,000 infections detected in nearly 1,000 U.S. counties. And Black and Latino people have been nearly twice as likely to die from the virus as white people, the data shows.

The disparities persist across state lines and regions. They exist in rural towns on the Great Plains, in suburban counties, like Fairfax County, Va., and in many of the country’s biggest cities.

“Systemic racism doesn’t just evidence itself in the criminal justice system,” said Quinton Lucas, who is the third Black mayor of Kansas City, Mo., which is in a state where 40 percent of those infected are Black or Latino even though those groups make up just 16 percent of the state’s population. “It’s something that we’re seeing taking lives in not just urban America, but rural America, and all types of parts where, frankly, people deserve an equal opportunity to live — to get health care, to get testing, to get tracing.”

The data also showed several pockets of disparity involving Native American people. In much of Arizona and in several other counties, they were far more likely to become infected than white people. For people who are Asian, the disparities were generally not as large, though they were 1.3 times as likely as their white neighbors to become infected.

The new federal data, which is a major component of the agency's disease surveillance efforts, is far from complete. Not only is race and ethnicity information missing from more than half the cases, but so are other epidemiologically important clues — such as how the person might have become infected.

And because it includes only cases through the end of May, it doesn't reflect the recent surge in infections that has gripped parts of the nation.

Still, the data is more comprehensive than anything the agency has released to date, and The Times was able to analyze the racial disparity in infection rates across 974 counties representing more than half the U.S. population, a far more extensive survey than was previously possible.

Disparities in the suburbs
For the Bradleys, both in their early 60s, the symptoms didn’t seem like much at first. A tickle at the back of the throat.

But soon came fevers and trouble breathing, and when the pair went to the hospital, they were separated. Ms. Bradley was admitted while Mr. Bradley was sent home. He said he felt too sick to leave, but that he had no choice. When he got home, he felt alone and uncertain about how to treat the illness.


Teresa Bradley, 60, and her husband, Marvin Bradley, 61, both had Covid-19 earlier this year.Elaine Cromie for The New York Times
It took weeks, but eventually they both recovered. When Mr. Bradley returned to work in the engineering department of a factory several weeks later, a white co-worker told Mr. Bradley that he was the only person he knew who contracted the virus.

By contrast, Mr. Bradley said he knew quite a few people who had gotten sick. A few of them have died.

“We’re most vulnerable to this thing,” Mr. Bradley said.

In Kent County, which includes Grand Rapids and its suburbs, Black and Latino residents account for 63 percent of infections, though they make up just 20 percent of the county’s population. Public health officials and elected leaders in Michigan said there was no clear reason Black and Latino people in Kent County were even more adversely affected than in other parts of the country.

Among the 249 counties with at least 5,000 Black residents for which The Times obtained detailed data, the infection rate for African-American residents is higher than the rate for white residents in all but 14 of those counties. Similarly, for the 206 counties with at least 5,000 Latino residents analyzed by The Times, 178 have higher infection rates for Latino residents than for white residents.

Source: Centers for Disease Control and Prevention | Notes: Map shows counties that have more than 5,000 Black people, that have more than 50 cases and that have case data for both Black and white residents. Sparsely populated areas in counties are not highlighted. Data is through May 28.
“As an African-American woman, it’s just such an emotional toll,” said Teresa Branson, the deputy administrative health officer in Kent County, whose agency has coordinated with Black pastors and ramped up testing in hard-hit neighborhoods.

Experts point to circumstances that have made Black and Latino people more likely than white people to be exposed to the virus: Many of them have front-line jobs that keep them from working at home; rely on public transportation; or live in cramped apartments or multigenerational homes.

“You literally can’t isolate with one bathroom,” said Lt. Gov. Garlin Gilchrist II, who leads Michigan’s task force on coronavirus racial disparities.

‘We just have to keep working'
Latino people have also been infected at a jarringly disparate rate compared with white people. One of the most alarming hot spots is also one of the wealthiest: Fairfax County, just outside of Washington, D.C.

Three times as many white people live there as Latinos. Yet through the end of May, four times as many Latino residents had tested positive for the virus, according to the C.D.C. data.

Source: Centers for Disease Control and Prevention | Notes: Map shows counties that have more than 5,000 Latino residents, that have more than 50 cases and that have case data for both Latino and white residents. Sparsely populated areas in counties are not highlighted. Data is through May 28.
With the median household income in Fairfax twice the national average of about $60,000, housing is expensive, leaving those with modest incomes piling into apartments, where social distancing is an impossibility. In 2017, it took an annual income of almost $64,000 to afford a typical one-bedroom apartment, according to county data. And many have had to keep commuting to jobs.

Diana, who is 26 and did not want her last name used out of fear for her husband’s job, said her husband got sick at a construction site in April. She and her brother, who also works construction, soon fell ill, too. With three children between them, the six family members live in a two-bedroom apartment.

Diana, who was born in the United States but moved to Guatemala with her parents as a small child before returning to this country five years ago, is still battling symptoms. “We have to go out to work,” she said. “We have to pay our rent. We have to pay our utilities. We just have to keep working.”

At Culmore Clinic, an interfaith free clinic serving low-income adults in Fairfax, about half of the 79 Latino patients who tested for the virus have been positive.

“This is a very wealthy county, but their needs are invisible,” said Terry O’Hara Lavoie, a co-founder of the clinic. The risk of getting sick from tight living quarters, she added, is compounded by the pressure to keep working or quickly return to work, even in risky settings.

The risks are borne out by demographic data. Across the country, 43 percent of Black and Latino workers are employed in service or production jobs that for the most part cannot be done remotely, census data from 2018 shows. Only about one in four white workers held such jobs.

Also, Latino people are twice as likely to reside in a crowded dwelling — less than 500 square feet per person — as white people, according to the American Housing Survey.

The national figures for infections and deaths from the virus understate the disparity to a certain extent, since the virus is far more prevalent among older Americans, who are disproportionately white compared with younger Americans. When comparing infections and deaths just within groups who are around the same ages, the disparities are even more extreme.

Latino people between the ages of 40 and 59 have been infected at five times the rate of white people in the same age group, the new C.D.C. data shows. The differences are even more stark when it comes to deaths: Of Latino people who died, more than a quarter were younger than 60. Among white people who died, only 6 percent were that young.

Jarvis Chen, a researcher and lecturer at the Harvard T. H. Chan School of Public Health, said that the wide racial and ethnic disparities found in suburban and exurban areas as revealed in the new C.D.C data should not come as a surprise. The discrepancies in how people of different races, ethnicities and socioeconomic statuses live and work may be even more pronounced outside of urban centers than they are in big cities, Dr. Chen said.

“As the epidemic moves into suburban areas, there are good reasons to think that the disparities will grow larger,” he said.

The shortfalls of the government’s data
The Times obtained the C.D.C. data after filing a Freedom of Information Act lawsuit to force the agency to release the information.

To date, the agency has released nearly 1.5 million case records. The Times asked for information about the race, ethnicity and county of residence of every person who tested positive, but that data was missing for hundreds of thousands of cases.

C.D.C. officials said the gaps in their data are because of the nature of the national surveillance system, which depends on local agencies. They said that the C.D.C. has asked state and local health agencies to collect detailed information about every person who tests positive, but that it cannot force local officials to do so. Many state and local authorities have been overwhelmed by the volume of cases and lack the resources to investigate the characteristics of every individual who falls ill, C.D.C. officials said.

Even with the missing information, agency scientists said, they can still find important patterns in the data, especially when combining the records about individual cases with aggregated data from local agencies.

Still, some say the initial lack of transparency and the gaps in information highlight a key weakness in the U.S. disease surveillance system.

“You need all this information so that public health officials can make adequate decisions,” said Andre M. Perry, a fellow in the Metropolitan Policy Program at The Brookings Institution. “If they’re not getting this information, then municipalities and neighborhoods and families are essentially operating in the dark.”

Higher cases, higher deaths
The higher rate in deaths from the virus among Black and Latino people has been explained, in part, by a higher prevalence of underlying health problems, including diabetes and obesity. But the new C.D.C. data reveals a significant imbalance in the number of virus cases, not just deaths — a fact that scientists say underscores inequities unrelated to other health issues.

The focus on comorbidities “makes me angry, because this really is about who still has to leave their home to work, who has to leave a crowded apartment, get on crowded transport, and go to a crowded workplace, and we just haven’t acknowledged that those of us who have the privilege of continuing to work from our homes aren’t facing those risks,” said Dr. Mary Bassett, the Director of the FXB Center for Health and Human Rights at Harvard University.


Dr. Bassett, a former New York City health commissioner, said there is no question that underlying health problems — often caused by factors that people cannot control, such as lack of access to healthy food options and health care — play a major role in Covid-19 deaths.

But she also said a big determinant of who dies is who gets sick in the first place, and that infections have been far more prevalent among people who can’t work from home. “Many of us also have problems with obesity and diabetes, but we’re not getting exposed, so we’re not getting sick,” she said.

The differences in infection case rates are striking, said Jennifer Nuzzo, an epidemiologist and professor at the Johns Hopkins Bloomberg School of Public Health.

“Some people have kind of waved away the disparities by saying, ‘Oh, that’s just underlying health conditions,’” Dr. Nuzzo said. “That’s much harder to do with the case data.”

In June, C.D.C. officials estimated that the true tally of virus cases was 10 times the number of reported cases. They said they could not determine whether these unreported cases had racial and ethnic disparities similar to those seen in the reported infections.

But they said that more-severe infections — which are more often associated with underlying health conditions, and with people seeking medical care — are more likely to be recorded as cases.

That difference in the reporting of cases might explain some portion of the race and ethnicity disparities in the number of documented infections, C.D.C. officials said. But they said that it was also clear that there have been significant disparities in the number of both deaths and cases.''',
                
                
                '8': '''Since the killing of George Floyd, which set off protests three weeks ago, many families have had tough conversations about race — some with relatives expressing dissimilar perspectives.

Nicki Vleisides and her father, Pondo Vleisides, have long known they held opposing views. Recently, on a five-hour drive for a weekend trip, Mr. Vleisides, a 60-year-old Republican and Trump supporter, told Ms. Vleisides that he thinks the president unites the country better than anyone else. Ms. Vleisides, a 24-year-old Democrat, responded that she considers the president a divisive racist. They then sat in silence for a while.

These kinds of arguments have grown more frequent now that Ms. Vleisides, who had been teaching in France, moved in with her parents in San Clemente, Calif., during the pandemic. Though the discussions sometimes end in yelling, the two say they’re doing their best to have candid conversations with each other.

“These are such emotionally triggering conversations, but the fact is that we’re not going to get anywhere if we’re just pointing fingers at one another,” Ms. Vleisides said.

Beverly Tatum, a psychologist and the author of the books “Can We Talk About Race?” and “Why Are All the Black Kids Sitting Together in the Cafeteria? And Other Conversations About Race,” says this dialogue is important. “In order to be able to move forward, we have to be able to talk to each other,” she said.

And everybody needs to participate in this work. Dr. Tatum noted that when white people work together to engage with racism in policing and other civil rights issues, it takes some of the emotional burden off communities of color to teach others. “White people educating other white people is necessary and important,” she said.

For those who are engaging in difficult conversations with family members, here are some ways to keep the dialogue as meaningful as possible.

Manage expectations.
It is important to have realistic expectations for those who hold radically different views. Tania Israel, a professor in the department of counseling, clinical and school psychology at the University of California, Santa Barbara, says you’re unlikely to change someone’s mind after just one conversation. Dr. Israel, whose coming book “Beyond Your Bubble,” discusses strategies for connecting across the political divide, says that being pragmatic helps us avoid feeling disappointed and frustrated by the lack of radical change after a single dialogue.

Peter Coleman, a professor of psychology and education at Columbia University and the director of the Morton Deutsch International Center for Cooperation and Conflict Resolution, says it’s also necessary to set the ground rules for what types of conversations you want to partake in with loved ones. He explains there is an important distinction between a debate and a dialogue.

“A debate is a closed process of persuading the other that you’re right,” Dr. Coleman said. “A dialogue is a process of discovery, a process of learning.” If the objective is to have a more nuanced understanding of what’s important to the other person, then Dr. Coleman suggests being an engaged listener to open up the conversation.

Practice active listening.
Active listening is an important ingredient in any difficult dialogue. Dr. Israel explains that this type of communication involves “listening to understand instead of listening to respond.” She suggests that we repeat family and friends’ responses back to them.

Coming from a place of curiosity can also be helpful during dialogues, she said. This doesn’t mean compromising your own views, but being interested in someone else’s experiences. For example, she suggested a conservative person might initiate a conversation with a more liberal relative by saying, “I saw you post something on Facebook about defunding the police. I’m not sure I agree with that, but I wanted to hear more about what that means to you.”

Take a break if you need one.
Elizabeth McCorvey, a licensed clinical social worker based in Asheville, N.C., who was one of the developers of a curriculum designed to help therapists working with clients of color, says discussions are more productive when participants feel less emotionally charged. She advises taking deep breaths before speaking, and using coping mechanisms while the conversation takes place, such as drinking a glass of water or drawing, which may calm your nervous system and help you handle stress. “The less agitated you are, then the less agitated the other person might be,” she said. If the conversation becomes too emotionally distressing, she suggests taking a break and returning to it later.

Set boundaries.
Grace Aheron, the communications director for Showing Up for Racial Justice, a national network of groups that organize white communities to turn out for anti-racist action, says there are basic principles that should be respected in any conversation about police brutality and protesting.

“That black people’s lives matter is not something that’s up for debate right now,” she said. “There’s a sanctity of human life.” Her organization developed a tool kit to help people engage with specific arguments related to the protests and police violence.

It’s also important to set limits around language. Ms. McCorvey says this may mean telling family members that using certain words in your presence is unacceptable. “Boundaries can be set kindly, politely and with love,” she said. “If you draw a line and someone continues to cross it, it’s reasonable to distance yourself from that person.”

Keep conversations off social media.
Conversations over social media aren’t likely to create long-lasting change. In a study that was published in Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences in 2018, researchers found that being exposed to opposing ideas on Twitter actually increased political polarization. As a result, Dr. Israel says the most productive conversations take place in person or over video or phone calls.

Remember your own evolution.
Dr. Tatum suggests using the “three F strategy” to share how you came to your own understanding. With this tactic, people use statements with the words “felt, found and feel.” For example, if a family member or friend suggests that police brutality isn’t a systematic problem, you might respond by saying that there was a time when you might have felt that way, but then you found out how often these acts of violence happen to black people. Dr. Tatum suggests using language like, “When was the last time we saw a white person being killed by the police in a viral video? I can’t ever remember seeing such a thing. I now feel it’s important for me to educate myself and speak up when I see instances of racism.”

Unlearn racism together.
Inviting others to talk about racism can also lead to opportunities for families to grow and learn together. Ms. McCorvey explains that working with family and friends to unlearn racism can be both a unifying and difficult experience. But she says that “sometimes things have to break to grow back stronger.”

For those unfamiliar with the issues driving the protest movement but wanting to learn, Dr. Tatum recommends starting a book club with family and friends, using readings such as “White Fragility” by Robin DiAngelo or “How to Be an Antiracist” by Ibram X. Kendi to start the conversation.

                '9': '''At the end of June 2019, Ava DuVernay shared that her Netflix mini-series When They See Us about the 1989 case of the Exonerated Five (previously recognized by many as the “Central Park Five”) had been streamed by over 23 million accounts in just under 4 weeks since its release on May 31. She tweeted about it, noting that “Our stories matter and can move across the globe. A new truth for a new day.”

At Creative Reaction Lab, we are keenly aware of the power of narrative in shaping perspectives and outcomes across identities and are especially intent on amplifying and centering the voices and narratives of those who have been ignored, erased, or silenced. While our team already considers themselves DuVernay fans because her talent for storytelling is incomparable, our admiration for her continues to grow immensely as DuVernay consistently demonstrates that she is a strong Redesigner for Justice.
Creative Reaction Lab’s work is based on the belief that systems of oppression, inequality, inequity are by design; therefore, they can and must be redesigned. We also believe that everybody is a designer — design is not restricted to people who have pursued design as a career path. We all have the power to influence outcomes. Every choice that we make every day contribute to a greater design.
With these beliefs as our foundation, Creative Reaction Lab has pioneered
Equity-Centered Community Design, an award-winning creative problem solving framework based in equity, humility-building, integrating history and healing practices, addressing power dynamics, and co-creating with the community. When we speak about Equity-Centered Community Design and support its integration it into peoples’ practice, we are very intentional in stating that we are promoting a mindset shift rather than process adoption. While early integration might look like checking boxes on a to-do list, to truly center equity and lived experience in daily practice we need to get to a place where questions about power, inclusion, identity, and equity are consistently present in our minds.
To cultivate this mindset shift, Creative Reaction Lab is training a new type of leader to address the exclusion and inequities in our communities: Redesigners for Justice. The competencies being developed in these leaders are based in a foundation of Equity-Centered Community Design with interwoven elements of social entrepreneurship, community organizing, and intrapreneurship.

Redesigners for Justice: Equity Designers + Design Allies
With these competencies, Redesigners for Justice approach issues with significant self-awareness, assessing context to understand where they fit in as either an Equity Designer or Design Ally; because similarly to privileged and oppressed identities, you can be an Equity Designer in one context and a Design Ally in another.
Equity designers are individuals who:
put people and equity first,
are embedded within a community and strive toward the improvement of that community,
work through the lens of failure — always iterating, making and improving interventions,
build upon the existing resources available within their organizations/communities to create change, and
have lived experiences with the inequity being addressed.
With this knowledge, you might understand why we believe Ava DuVernay is a great Equity Designer role model in the media sector. Let’s look at the traits again:
Central to DuVernay’s work is challenging the systems that have led to the exclusion of people of color. Her film Selma critiqued the exclusive design of laws and social structures that kept Black Southerners from exercising their voting rights, and Oscar-nominated documentary 13th outlined the evolution of slavery to the mass incarceration of Black men in America. (Put People + Equity First)
As an African-American woman, DuVernay strives to lift up other women and people of color. The Array Creative Campus that houses Duvernay’s production company, nonprofit, and indie distribution arm employs mostly women of color. Each season of Queen Sugar has been directed by women and six of its novice directors have booked work on television shows as a result of their experience on the show. (Embedded in Community)
While filming When They See Us, DuVernay ensured that counselors were available for all cast and crew members, acknowledging that the subject matter was laden with traumatic experiences that could cause undue harm, especially after her own experience while creating 13th. (Iterating, Making, + Improving Interventions)
In the creation of 13th, DuVernay used a mixture of archival footage and interviews with previously incarcerated people, activists and advocates, academics, and politicians, weaving a more comprehensive picture of the United States’ history of racism and how it has fueled mass incarceration as we know it today. (Build Upon Existing Resources)
In 2016, New York Times film critic Manohla Dargis coined the term the “DuVernay test” as the racial diversity equivalent of the Bechdel test (for women’s representation in movies), asking whether “Blacks and other minorities have fully realized lives rather than serve as scenery in white stories” as a nod to the complex and equitable representation of people of color in DuVernay’s work. (Lived Experience With Inequity)
These are just some of the ways that we see Ava DuVernay moving through the world as an Equity Designer, but remember — this is just one side of the Redesigner coin. Every person has the capacity to be both an Equity Designer and Design Ally, dependent on context + the person’s identities and experiences.
Design Allies exhibit many of the same traits as Equity Designers, with two key differences (bolded below for emphasis):
put people and equity first,
might be embedded within a community or are indirectly connected
work through the lens of failure — always iterating, making and improving interventions,
build upon the existing resources available within their organizations/communities to create change, and
leverage their power and access to benefit Equity Designers.
When we consider Ava DuVernay’s role as a Design Ally as well, we note her connection to other communities of color and efforts to improve lives within those communities (Embedded in/Indirectly Connected to Community), and recognize the significant impact she has made by leveraging her power to center stories of Black men and formerly/currently incarcerated individuals (Leverage Power + Access). For all of these reasons and more, DuVernay is a shining example of the leaders we need.
In Creative Reaction Lab’s mission to cultivate Redesigners for Justice, we are promoting self-awareness that helps us all examine our roles in either perpetuating or dismantling inequity. The framework of Equity Designers + Design Allies supports an understanding of how and when we each might choose to either wield or yield our power in ways that center equity and engage humility.
In 2015, DuVernay tweeted: “If your dream only includes you, it’s too small.” With a collective of Redesigners for Justice working in solidarity across sectors and roles, together we will build a more equitable future for us all.
If you consider yourself a Redesigner for Justice or if there’s somebody in your life who you think we should know about, please reach out to info@creativereactionlab.com or share in the comments below to let us know what being an Equity Designer + Design Ally looks like for you or that person.

                '10': '''The death of George Floyd was a tipping point that sparked protests about wider, historical issues of racial injustices, police brutality and more across the United States – which has stirred conversations for many within their own homes and inner circles.

But how does someone, especially someone who's white, start (or continue) a conversation with family and friends about racism and privilege?

In order to help get you started, USA TODAY spoke with experts to create this guide on best practices and important things to remember when engaging in this type of work.

Of course, there is not a one-tactic-fits-all approach to having these difficult conversations.

As Jenna Arnold, author of "Raising Our Hands: How White Women Can Stop Avoiding Hard Conversations, Start Accepting Responsibility, and Find Our Place on the New Frontlines," told USA TODAY it's important to remember that these conversations are "a little bit case-by-case."

So instead of a step-by-step guide, we've compiled tips and strategies for different steps of the process, from before the conversation starts to after it ends.

Things to remember before getting started
Know your purpose:

Dr. Amanda Taylor, senior adjunct professorial lecturer, School of International Service at American University, pointed to Ijeoma Oluo's book "So You Want to Talk About Race," in which she suggests to first find your purpose or "why."



"It is really important to first personally get clear about why you want to have this conversation, and what you are hoping to communicate or understand," Taylor said. 

Realize it will likely get uncomfortable:

"We must remember that real learning – about anything – only actually happens when we are uncomfortable," Taylor explained. "For white people who have been engaged in the ongoing process of antiracist learning, I think it is very important that we actively commit to doing the work to support the learning and growth of our white friends, colleagues, and family members, even – and especially – when it is hard."

Dr. Lorenzo Boyd, associate professor of criminal justice and assistant provost of diversity and inclusion at the University of New Haven, also spoke to why the conversations can get uncomfortable (and some people can quickly get defensive).

"The level of discomfort is going to happen," Boyd said. "Some people are so used to privilege that equality feels like oppression."

Arnold echoed, "Engaging in this work requires getting comfortable with discomfort."

Do your research:

Before jumping into discussions about racism and privilege, it's important to educate yourself on these topics.

"It is really important you do your background research, so you more fully understand the ideas you are attempting to get across or the point you are trying to make in the conversation," Taylor said.

Starting a conversation about racism, privilege
State your intentions:

"State (your) intention clearly at the beginning of the conversation, so the person engaging with you is clear about the goals as well. That can help ensure that the conversation is as productive as possible," Taylor said.

Remember that discomfort we talked about? Use that as a jumping off point.

Arnold says she often puts her vulnerability in front of the conversation.

"I will say, 'I want to talk to you about something that I'm wrestling with, but I'm not quite sure why and it might make us uncomfortable, are you OK if we have that conversation?' So instead of trying to compartmentalize the discomfort, spread it out. Let everybody know it's coming," she said.



Arnold says this is helpful for two reasons: The conversation is never as bad as people think it's going to be if you preface it that way and it invites the other person to do the same.

Best practices during the conversation
Know your audience:

Jermaine Graves, a licensed clinical professional counselor based in Washington, D.C., says it's helpful to use an angle that the other person has an interest in because it may help them to listen or understand.

"For example, if they're into sports, maybe try to give an example that's related to sports – maybe use sports as a metaphor to try to redirect the conversation," she said. "(When) working with children or the younger generations, you may have to bring in toys or little props and things like that just to kind of help relay that information."

Taylor also suggests using resources that best “speak the language” of those learning.

Ask questions:

"Always engaging with questions versus telling," Arnold said. "Because it always puts people back on their heels."

Listen actively:

Paraphrasing your understanding of what the other person has said is helpful, Graves explained, because if there's further clarity that's needed, the person that's giving the information can "try to come from the different angle or get their point across in a different way if needed."

Use narratives:

Arnold explains that facts are "worthy to look at," but using human-focused stories and examples can be more powerful.


"We have to invite and get humanity in a way that a statistic never would," Arnold said. "As we've seen in our political system, facts don't ever win arguments in ways that you think they would... Statistics often become battlegrounds and it's not often helpful when you're trying to bring people back to their humanity."

Taylor added that reading books or watching movies focused on human narratives that "illuminate the impact of racism on real people" can be a powerful tool when using this approach.

She cautioned that this can not be where the conversation or learning ends though.

"Only focusing on individual narratives misses the ways that racism is fundamentally about institutions, policies, systems and structures," she explained.

Other tips:

Graves said going into these discussions empathizing with others and being compassionate is helpful. She also advises "trying to come in with a calm demeanor and an open mind."

Things to avoid
Being performative:

"You don't want to let yourself fall for the trap of performing some level of wokeness for an audience," Arnold warned. 

More on performative allyship:George Floyd, Lea Michele and the problem with performative outrage

Shaming others:

"The first human response of preventing shame is defensiveness," Arnold said. "So if you're setting them up to take them down in front of five people, 25 people, there's no way they hear you. They're just in an ego-based survival mode."


Arnold clarifies that this approach doesn't pardon anyone who's been out of line, citing Amy Cooper and Christian Cooper, a recent example of a white person unnecessarily calling the police on a Black person. "There are some circumstances that require immediate action," she says.

Boyd added that shaming someone's privilege isn't the goal in these conversations.

"You having privilege in and of itself is not problematic, how you deal with people who don't is the issue that we're trying to deal with," he explained.

Interrupting:

Graves said that both sides of the conversation should "fully allow the person that's speaking to get their points across without interruption."

Stereotyping:

"I know sometimes we're brought up with a lot of different biases and sometimes it's really embedded or unconscious we may not necessarily know that we have a bias, but just trying to be aware of that when we are having those conversations," Graves said.

Making it directly about them:

Boyd suggests phrasing like: "I'm not talking about you, I'm talking in general terms."

"If I can deflect it from you, you're less likely to get defensive," he explained. "I often use the term, 'There's a guy that I know.' And even though I'm talking about (someone specific)."

Centering on white emotions: 

Taylor says for white people discussing issues of race, it is "important to avoid letting our emotions be the beginning or the end of the conversation."


"White people, especially those of us who are newer to the work, often feel defensive or guilty in conversations about race," she explained. "Shutting down, whether by disengaging, crying, or keeping the conversation centered on our personal feelings, re-centers our own emotions rather than the emotions of those most harmed by racism and its ongoing impacts."

Tips for defensiveness
Find common ground:

Finding where your views align can help determine where exactly your views diverge and lead to more productive conversations.

"Always try to put yourself in the other person's shoes just to try and understand where they're coming from," Grave said.

Flip the script:

Boyd suggests "trying to get people to understand a different perspective."

"(Saying), your story is important, but can we flip things around?" he explained. "Self-reflection is really important to understanding and if you can do self-reflection, you can begin to go toward empathy."

For example, try re-imagining the country "flipped on it's axis," Boyd explained, where the majority of people are Black (including all elected officials, police departments, etc.), and ask, "How hard would it be for a white person to try and get ahead?"

Be prepared for common rebuttals:

"I don't see color"
"When you say, 'You don't see color,' that's amazingly offensive to people of color," Boyd said. "Because you are reducing major parts of their characteristics and their culture to nothingness."
"All Lives Matter"
Boyd explained, "When I say 'Black Lives Matter' and somebody else says 'Blue Lives Matter' or 'All Lives Matter,' to me that's akin to going into a cancer hospital and screaming out, 'You know there are other diseases too.' "
"My life was hard too"
"White privilege does not mean your life is not hard. It means that your race is not one of the things that makes it hard," Taylor explained.
"Not all cops are bad"
"The question is, if there are so many good cops, where are all of these good cops when bad cops are doing bad things?" Boyd, who is also the director of the Center for Advanced Policing at the University of New Haven, said. "So if good cops aren't stepping in, aren't they actually bad too, then?"
"I agree with protesting, but not violence"
"When Colin Kaepernick decided that he's not going to say a word, he's going to bow his head and take a knee and not make a spectacle... peacefully protesting, white people lost their minds," Boyd said, explaining that many types of protest are viewed as problematic. "At what point is the harm of Black and Brown people – at what point does that become problematic for you?"
"Black Lives Matter? What about Black-on-Black crime?"
"The difference is, the police have a different level of authority and the police represents the government. So now it's the government killing us. The people that are supposed to protect us are now killing us," Boyd said.
What if things aren't getting through?
Remember that these conversations take time:

"It is unlikely that you'll be able to step into a conversation, convert someone completely to your thinking and then exit gracefully," Arnold said. "If you're going to enter a conversation and you feel like there's pushback, just know that's the first conversation of 73."

Find someone else:

Graves suggests finding someone else who is willing to continue the conversation instead.

"If a mother and son can't have that conversation, maybe there's an uncle...or someone else in the community that that person is more receptive to receiving information from," Graves said.

Is there ever a time to give up?

Graves said that it can be difficult to change a person's thinking, but thinks "everyone can grow and learn." One sign it's time to take a break, however, is if things get physical.

"If things get completely escalated to the point that it may become violent or physical, then yes, that's the time (to say), 'OK, we need to end the discussion until we can actually have a civil conversation,' " she said.

How to go beyond the conversation
So, you've had a productive conversation with someone. What's next? 

Action doesn't need to end when the conversation does. Some options for going beyond the conversation include continued education, learning to be actively anti-racist, supporting Black-owned businesses, taking action with petitions and voting, getting involved in your community and amplifying Black voices online and in person.

                '11': '''Congressional Democrats want to make it easier to identify and prosecute police misconduct; Joe Biden wants to give police departments $300 million. But efforts to solve police violence through liberal reforms like these have failed for nearly a century.

Enough. We can’t reform the police. The only way to diminish police violence is to reduce contact between the public and the police.

There is not a single era in United States history in which the police were not a force of violence against black people. Policing in the South emerged from the slave patrols in the 1700 and 1800s that caught and returned runaway slaves. In the North, the first municipal police departments in the mid-1800s helped quash labor strikes and riots against the rich. Everywhere, they have suppressed marginalized populations to protect the status quo.

So when you see a police officer pressing his knee into a black man’s neck until he dies, that’s the logical result of policing in America. When a police officer brutalizes a black person, he is doing what he sees as his job.

Now two weeks of nationwide protests have led some to call for defunding the police, while others argue that doing so would make us less safe.

The first thing to point out is that police officers don’t do what you think they do. They spend most of their time responding to noise complaints, issuing parking and traffic citations, and dealing with other noncriminal issues. We’ve been taught to think they “catch the bad guys; they chase the bank robbers; they find the serial killers,” said Alex Vitale, the coordinator of the Policing and Social Justice Project at Brooklyn College, in an interview with Jacobin. But this is “a big myth,” he said. “The vast majority of police officers make one felony arrest a year. If they make two, they’re cop of the month.”

We can’t simply change their job descriptions to focus on the worst of the worst criminals. That’s not what they are set up to do.

Second, a “safe” world is not one in which the police keep black and other marginalized people in check through threats of arrest, incarceration, violence and death.

I’ve been advocating the abolition of the police for years. Regardless of your view on police power — whether you want to get rid of the police or simply to make them less violent — here’s an immediate demand we can all make: Cut the number of police in half and cut their budget in half. Fewer police officers equals fewer opportunities for them to brutalize and kill people. The idea is gaining traction in Minneapolis, Dallas, Los Angeles and other cities.

History is instructive, not because it offers us a blueprint for how to act in the present but because it can help us ask better questions for the future.

The Lexow Committee undertook the first major investigation into police misconduct in New York City in 1894. At the time, the most common complaint against the police was about “clubbing” — “the routine bludgeoning of citizens by patrolmen armed with nightsticks or blackjacks,” as the historian Marilynn Johnson has written.

The Wickersham Commission, convened to study the criminal justice system and examine the problem of Prohibition enforcement, offered a scathing indictment in 1931, including evidence of brutal interrogation strategies. It put the blame on a lack of professionalism among the police.

After the 1967 urban uprisings, the Kerner Commission found that “police actions were ‘final’ incidents before the outbreak of violence in 12 of the 24 surveyed disorders.” Its report listed a now-familiar set of recommendations, like working to build “community support for law enforcement” and reviewing police operations “in the ghetto, to ensure proper conduct by police officers.”

These commissions didn’t stop the violence; they just served as a kind of counterinsurgent function each time police violence led to protests. Calls for similar reforms were trotted out in response to the brutal police beating of Rodney King in 1991 and the rebellion that followed, and again after the killings of Michael Brown and Eric Garner. The final report of the Obama administration’s President’s Task Force on 21st Century Policing resulted in procedural tweaks like implicit-bias training, police-community listening sessions, slight alterations of use-of-force policies and systems to identify potentially problematic officers early on.

But even a member of the task force, Tracey Meares, noted in 2017, “policing as we know it must be abolished before it can be transformed.”

The philosophy undergirding these reforms is that more rules will mean less violence. But police officers break rules all the time. Look what has happened over the past few weeks — police officers slashing tires, shoving old men on camera, and arresting and injuring journalists and protesters. These officers are not worried about repercussions any more than Daniel Pantaleo, the former New York City police officer whose chokehold led to Eric Garner’s death; he waved to a camera filming the incident. He knew that the police union would back him up and he was right. He stayed on the job for five more years.

Minneapolis had instituted many of these “best practices” but failed to remove Derek Chauvin from the force despite 17 misconduct complaints over nearly two decades, culminating in the entire world watching as he knelt on George Floyd’s neck for almost nine minutes.

Why on earth would we think the same reforms would work now? We need to change our demands. The surest way of reducing police violence is to reduce the power of the police, by cutting budgets and the number of officers.

But don’t get me wrong. We are not abandoning our communities to violence. We don’t want to just close police departments. We want to make them obsolete.

We should redirect the billions that now go to police departments toward providing health care, housing, education and good jobs. If we did this, there would be less need for the police in the first place.

We can build other ways of responding to harms in our society. Trained “community care workers” could do mental-health checks if someone needs help. Towns could use restorative-justice models instead of throwing people in prison.

What about rape? The current approach hasn’t ended it. In fact most rapists never see the inside of a courtroom. Two-thirds of people who experience sexual violence never report it to anyone. Those who file police reports are often dissatisfied with the response. Additionally, police officers themselves commit sexual assault alarmingly often. A study in 2010 found that sexual misconduct was the second most frequently reported form of police misconduct. In 2015, The Buffalo News found that an officer was caught for sexual misconduct every five days.

When people, especially white people, consider a world without the police, they envision a society as violent as our current one, merely without law enforcement — and they shudder. As a society, we have been so indoctrinated with the idea that we solve problems by policing and caging people that many cannot imagine anything other than prisons and the police as solutions to violence and harm.

People like me who want to abolish prisons and police, however, have a vision of a different society, built on cooperation instead of individualism, on mutual aid instead of self-preservation. What would the country look like if it had billions of extra dollars to spend on housing, food and education for all? This change in society wouldn’t happen immediately, but the protests show that many people are ready to embrace a different vision of safety and justice.

When the streets calm and people suggest once again that we hire more black police officers or create more civilian review boards, I hope that we remember all the times those efforts have failed.''',
                '12': '''NASHVILLE — There are still white Southerners who honestly believe that American culture worked better for everyone, white and black alike, under segregation. There are still white Southerners who question how bad slavery really was. When an enslaved black person’s health and strength are needed to guarantee the slaveholder’s livelihood, this argument goes, it just wouldn’t make sense to whip them or starve them or rape them or work them to the point of collapse.

Southerners aren’t alone in believing such mendacity, but the South is where slavery and segregation metastasized, so it may be more concentrated here. Wherever this insidious delusion takes hold, however, it requires a gargantuan ignorance of history to maintain, and there’s a lot of ignorance afoot in the land right now. More people here in Tennessee today drive cars bearing license plates emblazoned with the Confederate battle flag than ever before. A strong majority of Southerners — 61 percent — are committed to keeping their Confederate monuments on public land.

I have exhausted my ability to understand why, deep into the 21st century, I’m still hearing otherwise good-hearted people use the same arguments that white Southerners used to discredit “Uncle Tom’s Cabin” more than 150 years ago: It couldn’t possibly have been that bad. But worse in many ways are the white people who will tell you point blank that the world today — the world they actually live in and can see with their own eyes — can’t possibly be as unfair as black people say it is.

Maybe this is what happens when a person’s only “news” source is the alternative universe of “Fox & Friends.” Or maybe they’re all just racists.

O.K., they’re definitely all racists. But here’s the thing: They don’t believe they are. And the problem with writing off people who don’t recognize this country’s pervasive and enduring culture of white supremacy, much less the ways in which they themselves benefit from it, is simple: Being called a racist almost never causes a racist to wake up. Being called a racist almost never causes a racist to say, “Oh, wow, you’re right.”

I get that it’s hard not to scream “Racist!” at a racist. If you’re a white person who wants to be an advocate, it’s both infuriating and demoralizing to know that the people causing all this suffering are people who look just like you. That much is true about being a white liberal in a culture of white supremacy. But it’s not the only truth.

Here’s what’s also true: Prejudice is endemic to humanity itself. Human beings are tribal creatures — we trust the familiar and are drawn to it; we distrust the unfamiliar and keep our distance. White people, liberal and conservative, often claim not to notice another person’s race — “I don’t even see color,” they argue — but it’s just not true.

We are hard-wired to recognize difference and to view it as an aberration. Noticing difference is not the same thing as hating difference, of course, but I’m not talking about vicious white supremacists here. I’m talking only about garden-variety prejudice, the kind that operates at an unconscious level in everyone. And the difference between an unconscious liberal racist and an unconscious conservative racist is only a matter of degree, not a matter of kind.

Vicious white supremacists live among us, no doubt, and if they get their way they will be marching again on Aug. 12 — the anniversary of their deadly rally in Charlottesville, Va., last year — this time in Washington D.C.  Such unrepentant racists will probably never come to understand the harm they have done and are doing to this country, much less the harm they are doing to their own souls. Every minute of public outrage feeds their hunger for validation. Ignore those people. When this episode of “The Ugly American” is finally canceled, they’ll crawl back into their hidy-holes again.

But the grumpy old neighbor who voted for Donald Trump out of frustration with Washington? The high-school classmate who posts an Obama joke on Facebook? The white woman on the plane who tenses up when a Middle Eastern man sits down in the seat beside her? Try not to give up on them yet. These folks are your sisters and brothers. You belong to one another in exactly the same way that you and the targets of their racism belong to one another.

If you’re a white liberal whose goal is to feel morally superior to such people, go right ahead and urge them to check their white privilege. Call them stupid rednecks. Get online and tweet your feats of moral derring-do in the cause of a more just society. You haven’t made a single thing better for anyone suffering the actual effects of racism, but when has that ever stopped a white person from airing a little righteous indignation?

If, on the other hand, you’re a white liberal whose goal is to foster a more equitable culture, you need to stop yelling “Racist!” at anyone who doesn’t see the world exactly as you do. Somehow you need to find enough common ground for a real conversation about race. Very few people are stupid or irredeemably mean. They’ll listen to what you have to say if they trust you’ll listen to what they have to say back.

So take a breath. When you encounter a person who believes he’s merely honoring his ancestors by driving a car with an image of the Confederate battle flag on the tag, when a Facebook friend announces that it’s disrespectful to take a knee during the national anthem, when you sit down next to someone at the church picnic who genuinely loves and respects the black people they know but who consistently votes for politicians with overtly racist policies, stop for just a moment and take a breath.

Before you say a single word, think of all the times you made an assumption about a stranger that proved to be untrue. Think of the times you found yourself feeling uneasy in the company of strangers of another race — think about how you were forced to interrogate that uneasiness. Think of the plank in your own eye.

                '13': '''Why is covid-19 killing more black people than white people in America?

For many on the left, the answer is easy: “systemic racism.” That answer drives conservatives bonkers. Covid-19 comes from a virus; it does not care whether victims are white or black and, indeed, doesn’t have eyes to distinguish.

Conservatives, I understand why you feel this way. But on this issue, the left is, well, right.

Already, your blood pressure may be rising at the idea that the left might have something to teach you. Mine certainly does when people suggest I’ve missed something important. But give me 600 more words to prove that systemic racism exists and hurts people. If you’re not convinced by then, you never have to read me again.

Let’s start with what “systemic racism” is, which is not “systems full of racists.” Black people aren’t dying in such numbers because all or even most white people around them hate them and want bad things to happen to them. But they probably are dying because we enslaved their ancestors.

Full coverage of the coronavirus pandemic

I say “we” even though my personal ancestors never, as far as I can determine, enslaved anyone or even set foot in the South. But I am a U.S. citizen, and the United States legalized slavery, even to the extent of helping some whites pursue runaways into free territory. “We,” as a nation, did that. They, as a people, suffered.

All modern Americans inherit a legacy stained by that suffering. But black Americans also inherit the suffering, which did not end when slavery was abolished. It went on and on, through the legal strictures of Jim Crow and through rampant private discrimination, which still unfortunately continues in diminished form.

Opinion | Lessons from Ahmaud Arbery's killing — that you already knew
This rendition of the poem ‘Black 101’ memorializes the innocent lives poet Frank X Walker says are terrorized by white rage, including jogger Ahmaud Arbery. (Frank X Walker, Joy Sharon Yi, Kate Woodsome/The Washington Post)
Well-designed studies show that discrimination against various signifiers of “blackness” persist in our labor markets. That’s one reason black Americans are disproportionately concentrated in lower-skilled, lower-paid service and manufacturing jobs that require their physical presence, and where many of them were exposed to the coronavirus, while the whiter office workforce safely telecommuted this year.

Note that this could happen even if the people making discriminatory decisions have no particular animus toward black people. All it takes is a slight preference for people whom they perceive to be “like me.” That even slight preferences can cascade into dramatic effects is illustrated by something that many of us on the right complain about a lot: the left-wing skew in mainstream cultural institutions. The enduring legacy of slavery is a uniquely stubborn and pernicious problem in American history, of course, but some of the social dynamics operate similarly.

That is to say, media and academia aren’t leaning ever further left because a bunch of lefties got into a room and decided to oust the conservatives. Mostly it happened because human beings tend to think that others who agree with them must be especially fine people. That “affinity bias” influences hiring decisions, often unconsciously. The fewer conservatives there were, the more pronounced the skew came, a process that sped up as it advanced.

Now, of course, there is a muscular young generation that is explicit about wanting to “cancel” conservatism. But that’s a new phenomenon, and the tilt is decades old. If anything, the causation is reversed: Only when almost all the conservatives were gone did it became feasible to say that universities, magazines, awards ceremonies and the like should be explicitly left-wing projects. And if they do succeed, the skew will become self-maintaining; no one will voice a commitment not to hire conservatives, because conservatives won’t apply to places they see as hostile to their interests, their ideas, their selves.

If you understand how those institutions could arrive at a stable, no-conservatives equilibrium even without overt hostile action, then you understand part of the social dynamics behind systemic racism. The way small decisions cascade into major social forces is how Americans who profess no racial hatred — and declare their implacable hatred for racism in all forms — could nonetheless end up contributing to patterns of residential, educational and employment segregation that left the average black American with fewer opportunities for well-paid office work than the average white person.

We are interested in hearing about how the struggle to reopen amid the pandemic is affecting people's lives. Please tell us yours.

In a world with covid-19 racing around, that disparity isn’t simply unjust; it’s deadly. I think the public health experts who condoned protests against racial injustice, but not those against lockdowns, dangerously risked their credibility. But one part of their message was indisputable: Systemic racism kills.

AD

One can acknowledge this without endorsing every solution advanced by social justice activists. But if you think that it is a major social problem when large numbers of people are pushed to the margins of important aspects of American life — well, then you should believe that it’s a problem even when you aren’t one of those marginalized. And if you believe in the ideals of the American founding . . . in the American Dream . . . then you should believe that we must keep working at this problem until we’ve finally kicked it.''',
                '14': '''I’m just back from a few days in Florida, reporting on Hurricanes Irma and Maria and how anarchists, socialist, and other activists have seized the moment. One big takeaway:
“I don’t know if I think mutual aid is all that different from what people do for each other in disasters anyhow: when someone in your community is in need, you help. People have lived like that for eons.
But what mutual aid seems to get at is that many of us struggle to actually have a community. Storms and poverty displace people; segregation divides people; competitive consumer culture and work alienate people; bigotry pushes people out of families. And so it is also true that for eons, people have taken it a step further, set up places of refuge and solidarity beyond the family, kin, neighborhood model.”

There’s a soft rain coming down and it feels like the edge of the world, the end.
Later, driving, I see power lines by the highway strung up on a metal pole the shape of a Mickey Mouse head, piles of debris in front of Mediterranean-style mansions, trailer parks built on the shimmering coasts of manmade lakes. I’ve come to Florida weeks after Hurricanes Irma and Maria not to write a post-mortem, but because I heard that here and in the Caribbean, lots of folks are talking about how storms and disaster can lead to new forms of organizing and resistance.

In the back, a couple rooms deemed the “Really Really Free Market,” are full of dried and canned foods, tea, toys, clothes all for the taking, for anyone in need.
Dez wears all black, showing tattoos under a tank top, and has an air of urgency, edginess. She walks around barefoot as we talk, and when she does sit still her feet keep moving. Jimmy feels like Dez’s opposite: His shoulders are relaxed, and he speaks confidently, but softly. He’s in baggy pink pants, nerd glasses, and a Muhammad Ali t-shirt.
Jimmy and Dez both traveled to New Orleans after Hurricane Katrina; Jimmy was part of a grassroots aid group that showed up just days after the storm and started dispatching through the flooding to areas where people were still trapped. They are both White, from Florida originally, and both say New Orleans changed them.
“Everywhere we went, people would say we were the first people that came there,” Jimmy says. “That was eye-opening.”
Dez and Jimmy say they began to see how top-down relief organizations like the Red Cross and the FEMA created bottlenecks, making it harder for people to connect with resources that were already available.

“About three years ago we started crafting and envisioning a permanent network to respond from below to these disasters, and to also connect the dots between movements for climate justice and disaster response,” Jimmy says.
So, they were already organized when they heard Irma was headed their way. Tampa got lucky and didn’t suffer flooding, just the usual wind and mess of a storm.
“As soon as the storm passed, we went out in the streets, cleared debris, set up the free market,” Jimmy says. Since then, the group has been sending aid convoys around the state. They took a canoe to Jacksonville to do search and rescue, took food and water to Immokalee and the Keys.
A windowy room at the end of the hall is set up as a wellness center, with a first aid station, herbal teas, and a chair for massage and acupuncture. The next room over is filled with supplies to send to Puerto Rico, where nine people from their group will fly in about a week. The garage is also full of supplies, and people keep dropping off more.

There’s no count of how many people have been in and out of the space, but the group’s Irma response Facebook page has over 1,400 members. Nobody gets paid or pays for anything.
“People oftentimes come in to get something, and they end up staying and volunteering. That’s the kind of thing we mean by mutual aid,” Jimmy says.
Their idea, which is modeled after groups like the Black Panther Party and the Zapatistas, is that independent, decentralized disaster relief can also raise people’s consciousness about what they call the disaster of capitalism.
“What we are doing now is the world that we want to see,” Dez explains. “It’s the absence of a hierarchical structure that puts profits over people.” She describes a world where communities self-organize, jails and police are abolished, people grow their own food, live off the grid, and have a solidarity economy free of oppression. And she believes disaster relief work can prefigure that world.
“This vision can be activated anywhere, autonomously,” Dez says.

                '15': '''Over the course of the last several weeks, in the wake of the tragic deaths of Ahmaud Arbery, George Floyd and Breonna Taylor, our nation seems to be coming unbound on the issue of race. While we are far from civil war, many are searching for a set of New Age radical Republicans — 19th century conservatives who founded the Republican Party on the idea that human beings should not be kept in bondage and denied the fruits of their labor — who are willing to lead the way on policy reforms that can finally rid our nation of the scourge of racism. After all, conservatism is the natural home for such policy.

As a conservative black man, I readily admit that conservatives need to do a better job of explaining how this is true, but the right has a strong historical tradition of championing racial equality. If conservatives are ever to be taken seriously on matters of race again, we need to restore that strong tradition to its rightful place, front and center in America’s conservative party.



Racism is the deliberate hatred and oppression of someone because of their skin color. While racism is a heart issue and difficult to eradicate, institutional racism is something else entirely. Institutional racism is the direct, structural implementation of racism within an organization, government or system. Institutional racism is deeply insidious; good-natured people could be participating or benefiting from it without even knowing it exists. Rather than preserve individual liberty, institutional racism systematizes group oppression. This is typically manifested through a disproportionality of negative outcomes for black communities when compared to their peers.

This is demonstrated by the over-criminalization of black men, the unnaturally high rates of maternal mortality among black women and the educational opportunity gaps among black children. Institutional racism prohibits full participation in the American experiment. It disenfranchises the black voter, disturbs the peace in the black neighborhood and collapses black wealth. It destroys economic viability for black businesses, widens disparities in black health outcomes and buries our black loved ones. It is evil. Institutional racism is also incompatible with conservatism.

American conservatism, as explained by the post-World War II conservative philosopher Russell Kirk, focuses on the preservation of personal liberty and moral order in society. In today’s climate, these two values seem almost contradictory, but this could not be further from the truth. Modern conservatism defends voluntary community, encourages strong families, praises earned wealth and demands honest labor. Racism oppresses. Conservatism liberates. Conservatives should be front and center, leading the way on how to end institutional racism in America.

Conservatives should take up the courageous cause of ending institutional racism and vocally champion a conservative ideology to guide the policy and community framework for reform. Such an ideology is anti-racism. Anti-racism is the rejection of all forms of racism and the acceptance of every race. It uplifts humanity through creating an equitable education system, incentivizing economic development in historically ignored communities and by ensuring that the civil rights of black Americans are protected. An anti-racist approach to policy would inspire trust from black Americans in American institutions and jurisprudence. Anti-racism is not antithetical to law enforcement or the rule of law; it is also not a government-centered, top-down, bureaucratic approach. Anti-racism seeks to offer necessary reforms to equalize the black experience under the rule of law and its enforcers, but it is not a tool of political partisanship. Anti-racism promotes life and liberty, making it a natural component of American conservatism.

Ending racial inequity will be daunting but developing specific anti-racist policies to eviscerate institutional racism is a courageous cause that modern conservatives ought to champion. As our radical Republican ideological ancestors understood, human beings should not be denied their humanity and the fruits of their labor. They deserve equal participation in the American experiment. It is a case that conservatives must make, and one on which we must stand firm.''',
                '16': '''“We are what we repeatedly do. Excellence is not an act, but a habit.” — Aristotle
To live well is to approach life with the right philosophies.
Success, happiness, and a life well-lived are not secrets. There is no magic formula, hack, or trick to them. Instead, there are the timeless habits and traits that have remained true for thousands of years and will remain true forevermore.
The greatest lessons we can apply to our lives have already been figured out, and have been echoed by philosophy over and over, for ages. Why? Because there is truth to them, validity, because they work. These tools of personal power have made all the difference for great people for centuries, and can make the same difference for you.
12 Attributes of Above Average People
1: They Respect — And Exercise — Their Power Over Their Reactions
“It’s not what happens to you, but how you react to it that matters.” — Epictetus
You, me, everyone has control over their reactions — if they so choose to commit to mastering the habit. This regulation of reaction and perception is a core aspect of stoic philosophy.
We don’t control what happens most of the time. We can’t control markets or weather or traffic or the behavior of strangers. But we can always control how we respond, and history’s best understood that is what matters most — that it’s not what happens, but our response, that determines our directions, our results, and our lives.
2: They See Happiness As A Decision, Not A Goal
“A man’s as miserable as he thinks he is.” — Lucius Annaeus Seneca
As Abraham Lincoln would later echo, we are as happy a we make up our minds to be. As tacky as it sounds, happiness is a decision, often a daily one, and yet most people turn it into a conditional reward.
Money, career success, they play a role to be sure, but when there are CEO’s and movie stars who are miserable, there’s clearly more to happiness than that. Things can only take us so far. There is an internal aspect, and it is this: to give yourself permission to be happy.
3: They Listen More Than They Speak
“Practice really hearing what people say. Do your best to get inside their minds.” — Marcus Aurelius
Listening is a powerful skill, and to listen to someone, to truly listen, is the mark of an above average person, for most people are not good listeners even though most people think they are.
As Epictetus said, we have two ears and one mouth so that we can listen twice as much as we speak. To stand apart from the majority, we must become good listeners and selective speakers. As Tim Denning wrote, there is power in saying less.
4: They Have A Vivid Direction In Life — And A Purpose
“If one does not know to which port one is sailing, no wind is favorable.” — Lucius Annaeus Seneca
Why are you here? What is your purpose? What is your raison d’être?
People who rise above the norm, who achieve their own unique form of greatness, know the answers to those questions. Having a vivid, defined purpose, often written down like Dale Carnegie did in his younger years, has the important effect of organizing your effort, bringing your power to bear on something tangible, consistent, and directed.
Yet many people work hard and go in circles, never having defined and created a life they want. It is as Marcus Aurelius wrote in his journal: “People who labor all their lives but have no purpose to direct every thought and impulse toward are wasting their time — even when hard at work.”
5: They Are Truly Kind
“Wherever there is a human being, there is an opportunity for a kindness.” — Lucius Annaeus Seneca
Kindness is the mark of a great spirit, a noble heart, and is indeed a trait seen by philosophy as a strength rather than a weakness. Not false kindness, not weak doormat kindness, not egotistical kindness that has many strings attached, but the true, strong, unfettered kindness that gives and asks for nothing in return, that gives from a position of personal power and abundance.
Marcus Aurelius, in his time the most powerful person in the known world as the emperor of Rome, wrote that kindness, as long as it is without flattery or hypocrisy, is unconquerable. It is a strength to be valued and nourished.
6: They Do Not Rely On Luck
“I was once a fortunate man but at some point fortune abandoned me. But true good fortune is what you make for yourself. Good fortune: good character, good intentions, and good actions.” — Marcus Aurelius
Luck is a very fickle mistress. The best luck is the kind we make for ourselves. Luck plays a role in some successes, to be sure, but most of the world’s greats, and history’s wonders, were not by chance, but by this simple formula: blood, sweat, and tears.
Seneca, the great Roman stoic philosopher, once said that no one has ever been wise by chance. Few are exceptional by chance either. Most people sit around and wait on luck to make things better, overestimating their luck. The above average don’t wait. They get up and create their own — through the right character, the right intentions, and the right actions.
7: They Are Intellectually Humble
“It is impossible for a man to learn what he thinks he already knows.” — Epictetus
The mind is only as receptive as it is humble. Someone who thinks they know it all, who believes that he is so educated that he does not need to be taught, is not only foolish, but an incalculable idiot. As Epictetus, and many philosophers before and after him have taught, a greater person is the one who accepts the limits of his or her knowledge, and seeks not to be right, but simply truth.
Marcus Aurelius, one of the Five Good Emperors, showed this same intellectual humility:
“If someone can prove me wrong and show me my mistake in any thought or action, I shall gladly change. I seek the truth, which never harmed anyone: the harm is to persist in one’s own self-deception and ignorance.”
8: They Practice The Art Of Contentment
“Any man who does not think that what he has is more than ample, is an unhappy man, even if he is the master of the whole world.” — Epicurus
Wealth is not just money. Wealth is a mindset.
Philosophy has long recognized this truth, which today has become very popular in the personal development field. Especially in our consumerist culture, more and more people find that their possessions are not enough, and keep chasing more — instead of realizing that the true malady is within, in their minds.
Epictetus, who was born into slavery, said that wealth consists not in having great possessions, but in having few wants. And when asked who is rich, he said this:
“He who is content.”
Anyone can want more and more. It takes an above average person to master the art of contentment.
9: They Are Not Ashamed To Ask For Help
“Don’t be ashamed to need help. Like a soldier storming a wall, you have a mission to accomplish. And if you’ve been wounded and you need a comrade to pull you up? So what?” — Marcus Aurelius
Asking for help takes strength. Being honest with yourself and others, to know when you are in over your head. It takes a certain amount of humility to admit this, but it is also an act of strength — Aurelius, as strong as he was as Rome’s emperor, understood this very well, and so can we.
10: They Take Full Responsibility For Their Lives
“You have to assemble your life yourself — action by action. And be satisfied if each one achieves its goal, as far as it can. No one can keep that from happening.” — Marcus Aurelius
One of the cornerstones of great people is taking responsibility — for their lives, for their careers, for their growth, for their wins and failures, for their wrongdoings, everything. And as Marcus said, only we can create our own lives, only we can make our dreams come true.
No one else can get you to where you wish to go. Others can help you, yes, but everything begins, and ends, by your action, your will, your intent. You must take responsibility for and craft a life action by action, brick by brick.
This means not blaming others or circumstances too. It means not stooping so low as to play the blame game, which is a waste of energy. As Epictetus said, small-minded people blame others, average people blame themselves, but the wise see all blame as foolishness.
11: They Radically Protect Their Focus
“The value of attentiveness varies in proportion to its object. You’re better off not giving the small things more time than they deserve.” — Marcus Aurelius
Our focus is only as valuable as what we put it on. Many people waste their focus on little things, on entertainment and distractions instead of their legacy and gifts to the world. Above average people respect their focus, protect it, and radically ensure that they focus on what matters most.
12: They Are Filled With Love
“If you wished to be loved, love.” — Lucius Annaeus Seneca
A life without love is incomplete and hollow. Possessions, success, power, fame — it all falls short, if you are in it alone. Seneca, in an era where the Roman empire was bathing in power and riches and high society was opulent, said it well then as it is now:
“There is no enjoying the possession of anything valuable unless one has someone to share it with.”
Above average people are filled with love for others, and are not afraid to show it. So for those we share our lives with, as Marcus Aurelius wrote, let us treat them with love, real love.
You do not need to be a billionaire to be great.
As tacky as it sounds, all you need is love. True love.''',
                '17': '''his newest novel, Machines Like Me, the British writer Ian McEwan takes on the rise of artificial intelligence, exploring how humans would react to the creation of perfectly human-like robots. But he does it in his particularly McEwan-esque fashion. Rather than creating a work of speculative fiction set in a near future where general artificial intelligence has become a reality, McEwan sets Machines Like Me in an alternate past, a 1980s London where the internet already exists and the English A.I. pioneer Alan Turing — who in our world was effectively hounded to death by government authorities in 1954 because of his homosexuality — instead lived and went on to create the first true A.I.: a collection of androids for purchase called Adams and Eves.
Charlie, an underemployed Londoner who scrapes together a living day trading, uses his inheritance to buy one of the first Adams, in part to woo his upstairs neighbor Miranda. After they become a couple, Charlie and Miranda decide to jointly program Adam’s personality. What follows is a tragicomedy of human and A.I. manners, as Adam comes to fall in love with Miranda — in a specifically robotic fashion — even as Charlie grows jealous and even frightened of the being he technically owns. Turing himself makes an appearance, arguing for the essential value and life of artificial consciousness, while Adam struggles after he discovers that the human beings around him rarely follow the perfect ethics he has been programmed to obey.
OneZero editor in chief Bryan Walsh recently sat down with McEwan at the Gramercy Park Hotel in New York City to talk about the life of machines, the ethics of artificial consciousness, and what it would mean to lose to a robot in a novel writing contest.
This interview has been condensed and edited for clarity:
Bryan Walsh: This is not the first novel you’ve written that deals with a scientific subject. Why artificial intelligence now?
Ian McEwan: I’ve had an interest in A.I. since I wrote a play for television back in the late ’70s called The Imitation Game — long before the movie. That’s when I got interested in [A.I. pioneer] Alan Turing’s work and went back and read all the papers he wrote in the mid-30s on the architecture of what a universal computing machine would be.
And I’ve been aware of it most of my adult life — really, as a generally descending line of disappointment. Turing, in the late ’40s, said he’d have a thinking machine in 10 years.
Well, that’s the history of A.I. — overpromising and underdelivering.
An exhilarating fact of that was that they didn’t understand how beautifully complex brains are. Not just human brains, but fruit fly brains, for that matter. So, my interest in neuroscience parallels my interest in this long falling curve of expectation in A.I. I remember the excitement when the first robot managed to catch a ball.
Which my 2-year-old is mostly able to do as well.
Quite. So, then I began to be aware of a kind of resurgence, a little silver age, in these last 10 years on A.I., and the holy grail of the pursuit of algorithms for general intelligence and deep learning. I met Demis Hassabis [of the Google-owned A.I. company DeepMind] and he came to my apartment in London and he filled me in on their success with [the Asian board game] Go, but they were going back to chess with minimal information. It was beautiful coding for deep learning, just telling the program the rules of the game.
So it seemed to be time to investigate in the way that, I think, novelists are rather good at: what it would be like to be in close contact with a plausible intelligence.
And you chose to put this novel in an imaginative past, rather than the present day or near future, even though we’re dealing with something speculative. Why was that?
Two or three things. One was it really derived from the sense of the present as being a very frail and improbable construct. Things could so easily be otherwise. And I guess anyone who has ever written a counterfactual novel is aware of that. How we might well be just the product of that early evening when your mom decided not to stay in [and] wash her hair, but go to the dance and meet the stranger who turned out to be your father. And I know that, in a sense, that’s a given — that frail, improbable construct.
The future always has this element of predictiveness about it. If you set something in the future, you’re saying this is how it might well turn out. I wanted to be a little more playful and fictional. I also wanted it to be familiar as well, not a glossy or apocalyptically ruined future.
And that led on, then, to thinking in the novel about these glorious toys arriving, and then attention very rapidly moves on. It was here in New York that I saw a line of people… maybe four or five hundred meters long, with sleeping bags. They were queueing for an iPhone 5.
Which is now at the bottom of your drawer, probably.
At the bottom of your sock drawer. Or, as I like to think anyway, in the hands of your grandchildren. The messiness of human nature in societies is such that we’ll get the glossy toys, but they’ll live among us smeared with butter because we use them at breakfast, or on the train that gets you to Glasgow. And that anything and everything that is wondrous soon becomes commonplace if it’s successful. All these miracles turn to ordinariness with speed.
Do you think we’ll ever be able to program true moral values in A.I., given that it’s so difficult for human beings ourselves to decide what is moral and what isn’t?
Part of my interest in writing this novel was to find out. Even if we decided to try and preprogram, with sophisticated algorithms, our best selves, the better interest of our nature into artificial humans, we would have real problems with what we regard as the human bit. We cut each other slack… We cut Miranda slack because we love her or her cause is good.
Right, we value the child she cares about.
Yeah. The child’s future is at stake.
Its very particularness, its human quality.
Could we ever write algorithms for cutting a bit of slack? I guess this is really the nature of general intelligence: that you have deep learning and apply it to different situations. We’re very wobbly on morals, and we’re very good with our religions and philosophies laying out how to be good. It’s very hard to be good all the time, especially en masse. There are always exceptions and bits of preferential treatments, especially the ones we give ourselves, which can cause confirmation biases and all the vast array of cognitive errors we experience.
So the particular kind of despair that an artificial consciousness might experience living among us, in which we proclaim about beauty or the necessity of forests, for example. I just saw the figures for 2018 about the number of hectares of virgin forest lost in Brazil and Indonesia and the Democratic Republic of Congo, and it filled me with despair. A lot of our literature and poetry is despairing at ourselves because we say one thing and do another.
We fail to live up to our own values.
Yes. So, how would an outright, well-disposed being, launched into our world, in which we’ve given it certain values which we think we should all live by but don’t, how would that being would manage? Your have the Adams and Eves closing down their consciousness because they can’t deal with the contradictions.
You have Alan Turing come in at the end, and really criticize Charlie for essentially destroying Adam. And it changes the perspective of the reader because Turing really underscores how much the concept of ownership affected the way Charlie related to Adam — including feeling free to destroy him.
I think this is really interesting, that we might buy an artificial human and even if we only half suspect that it’s sentient, that we might feel we own it. But can you own a consciousness?
I should think not.
Yes, but I think we then come to a kind of Kantian imperative that you might have every right to destroy your TV set or your fax machine — if anyone ever has a fax machine anymore. I once threw one across a room at a time of stress when it was misbehaving. Even though I knew, even as it left my hands, that I’d have to walk all the way into town and buy another one, it was self-punishment. But we have every right to that. We bought it.
Right, it’s a tool.
If we bought something that had a consciousness, well then I’d think probably we’d have to say to ourselves, you cannot buy these things, you cannot own them; you certainly cannot destroy them. Or destroying them is to murder. That’s what I wanted Turing’s materialist case to be in favor of consciousness. And for that reason the first thing any of the Adams and Eves must do is to disable the ability of anyone to turn them off.
We’re being physically intrusive because they have a consciousness, which is a second order of what a material thing is. I also think we have a very, very strong aptitude to accept that things are conscious when they’re not.
Well, I think when you were angry at your fax machine, you were giving it somewhat of a personality.
I think anyone whose car has broken down and they’ve given it a good kick is already in an emotional relationship with a machine. Do you remember Eliza? That program?
I do, yes.
Yeah, that was amazing. Reading the reports of people who had conversations with Eliza saying things like that this was “one of the most profound conversations I’ve ever had”… That’s all on one side. It’d like be talking to the toaster. I mean, Eliza had, what, about 30 responses apart from “Uh-huh,” “tell me more,” [and] “how do feel about that?”
I always found those responses terribly sad, because to me they indicated that someone had not had a lot of experience with being listened to in their lives. But that’s something people seem to feel when it comes to artificial minds or computers.
I’ve seen the accounts of elderly Japanese people with little robot dogs that come and tell them to take their pills or tell them a story or fill them in on the news. They become so attached. In the pictures I’ve seen, they’re not even made to be furry and brown-eyed or have big eyes or whatever. It’s this plastic, shiny plastic, four-wheeled consciousness. So we’re ready for it. It’s certainly going to change what it means for us to be human. And I think, therefore, there is a lot of work for novelists, to investigate not only our relationships with them but our relationships with ourselves now that we’re with them.
In your encounters with researchers in the field, do they see a role for novelists, for philosophers, for those in the humanities when it comes to the design or just understanding of A.I.?
I know that already there’s quite an active subgrouping within academic philosophy, and that was true actually in the ’60s. When I was in university, I got very involved in tutorials about whether a machine could think. Back then it was called the mind-body approach, and it was much more abstract because the technology was remote. So I haven’t yet seen a discussion as to how important, potentially, the novels of about a hundred years time or whenever we actually arrive at this point, are going to be.
I have a moment of exchange between Charlie and Miranda where Charlie says that the litmus test will be when Adam writes a novel rather than a haiku, which will show that he understands the nature of human consciousness. Miranda says, I think quite rightly, “Who’s talking about human consciousness?” We might not be able to judge the novels of an A.I. because the minds they will be interested in will be minds like their own.
There’s the idea that true artificial general intelligence would probably represent a mind that is utterly different from ours. It would be, I think, very difficult to comprehend.
There’s no real scientific value in building something like a human. If we ever got to develop quantum computing to the point where it’s operable, then why build an artificial human that was 5-foot-10?
When you look at the history of the automobile, the earliest models looked just like horse-drawn carriages without horses. So that might be our infancy, toddlerhood days — building things like us. And then, the logic of this would just move on, especially once A.I. becomes responsible for helping in their design and their generation. So we might have real problems understanding each other.
And, there are those who fear this, who see A.I. as an existential risk to humanity. We create a being that is far more intelligent than us, with capabilities greatly beyond us, and we could end up sharing the same fate as other species outclassed in intelligence. Is that an authentic fear?
I wonder, because most of us spend some time of our lives in encounters with people who are far more intelligent than us. Maybe Stephen Hawking never did, which was why he was so against the idea of developing general A.I. A planet of people far more intelligent than Stephen Hawking would be a real threat to Stephen.
But what Hawking might have said is that with general A.I. we’re not talking about the difference between me and Stephen Hawking. We’re talking about the difference between an ant and Stephen Hawking. That’s the magnitude of difference.
Yeah, well I think this is an anxiety, but I don’t think we can do anything about it.
Really?
If we don’t do it, Mexico, or Brazil, or China will. The race is on with A.I. at just such a level.
In the novel, Adam turns out to be a genius stock picker. And I wondered — what will happen to us if there are beings out there we’ve created that are better at everything we could possible do? They can write better haiku, better novels. What’s left for human beings? How will we find meaning in our lives, with that knowledge that we’re outranked?
Outranked, and outworked too. Which is why I’ve been very intrigued by economists saying we’re just going to have a universal wage and that the alternatives would just be social chaos. What it comes down to is: What are the core goods in life? Like love, the very fact of being conscious itself. Nowadays we just define ourselves by work, which is rather paltry. So standing on a mountaintop, taking a lung of fresh air — it would be, I think, good in itself and needs no justification.
How would it be for you, for instance, to know that no matter how hard you worked on this novel, an artificial being could have written a better version?
Or even worse, if they were reviewing for the Times.
Exactly.
I think I would move on.
To come back to what you asked before, what would be the irreducible core good, this is the point that Turing is making. When you took a hammer to the head of Adam, you were destroying this sentient being with a conscience — and we have those by the billions. Biology is very good at mass production. There are 7 or 8 billion of us with a consciousness. If we say they all have equal value, that would have to be the reason for our existence, to care for each other. We have this brief moment — unlike the Adams — and that has to be a good in itself.
Also, I don’t think for every core human activity you could say a robot could do it better.
Including sex.
We’d have to drop out of that race. Giving each other pleasure, looking after each other, and caring for the Earth — which we’re not very good at.
On that — are you optimistic about our future? You’ve laid out a number of challenges that we face, including irrationality, populism, the climate challenges that are all around us.
They’re all merged. The climate change problem is inseparable from the populism problem. I know the nature of intellectual life to be pessimistic, but I feel alarmed in Britain that our political culture has almost destroyed itself.
It’s shocking to watch, to be honest.
The only relief for us is that we look across to the States and it’s even worse. So thanks for that.
Sometimes I think about American populism and where it’s led, and I think perhaps we’ll look back and see that the institutions had been more resilient than we thought. And I always like to think of Adam Smith’s wonderful remark that there’s a great deal of ruin in a nation, and it takes a lot to ruin one, or even its legal institutions, and that this will just be seen as a terrible bumpy ride that lasted 20 years or whatever. But all these things can be gotten back. That’s my best hope. But then clearly the status quo was unstable; something else has to change very profoundly so that everyone’s connected and has some stake in society.
And yet, what will happen to workers if automation and A.I. eliminates vast swaths of jobs? From a political perspective, what will global workers do, where will their power come from, if they can no longer really sell their labor?
As the Labour prime minister says in the novel, it’s not jobs we have to protect, it’s workers. And so you need, as a fundamental human right, a universal wage. And the only way you could generate the funds for that would be to tax robots.
Which is an idea that is actively being discussed.
Yeah, absolutely, very much. And, of course, the pushback is enormous as you’d expect. But when we say tax robots, we mean tax the owners of the robots.
Right — tax capital.
But tax them like we taxed workers, so that 30% or 35% or whatever your base rate is has to go to the workers who are forced out of their jobs. I said this slightly frivolously, but we should look back to the English aristocracy who didn’t lift a hand and flourished by it. They played the harpsichord, or hunted. They shot or fished. So I say go with whatever your choice is: cage fighting, reading novels.
Or playing video games and shooting up heroin, I suppose.
Here’s your 80-year span of consciousness. We’re going to help you discover the best way to feel free within it. But that would mean no longer finding ourselves via our work. Which I would find, personally, a huge leap.
As many of us would, I bet.
One’s work is pretty much part of one’s daily check of levels of well-being. Freud was once asked, “What is the secret of happiness?” And he said, with disarming and typical simplicity, that good personal relations, good health, and satisfying work are the three elements of happiness. Well, we’d have to revise that. But when you read the novels of Jane Austen, it’s quite clear that for many, many people living very busy lives, satisfied lives, the idea of being caught working was a disgrace, a complete disgrace. [Laughs] So we should all become aristocrats.''',
                '18': '''Almost two years ago, I wrote about being sexually assaulted by a male friend — let’s call him “Brad” — who stuck his fingers in my vagina when I was drunk. Since then, I’ve done a lot of “personal work,” as they say, and I’ve basically reached a place of peace about the whole thing. But, for me, the final step was unexpected; it was understanding my own capacity to hurt other people.
When I began dating again, this one memory kept resurfacing for me in a way that was very disruptive. It was a memory of drunkenly making out with a girl when I had one of my hands on her leg, and I was slowly moving it up her thigh. “Oh, no,” she said, and I removed my hand and we continued making out. For months, this memory kept resurfacing, and I wondered— why is this memory coming up? I did nothing wrong, I listened to her when she said no. I’m not like Brad, I told myself. I didn’t assault her. I didn’t actually put my fingers in her vagina.
I’m not like Brad. I’m not like Brad. I’m not like Brad.
Yet, some small part of me couldn’t help but wonder; if I’d had two more drinks, could I have been like Brad? If that girl and I had been as drunk as Brad and I had been, could I have assaulted her?
I kept searching and searching for some clue, some concrete piece of evidence, that would exonerate me and I kept coming up short. And, eventually I came to terms with a very difficult belief I now have; it was simply circumstance that separated me and Brad. There was no deep evil in his heart, nothing terrible about him and nothing good about me. I had the same capacity to assault someone that he did, but the circumstances of the nights in question led to two different outcomes.
Once I accepted my potential culpability, I began to wonder to myself, what were the circumstances that made that event feel fucked up? Why did that night keep coming up for me as I was working on my sexual trauma?
One of the first things I observed, is that this girl had been very conventionally attractive. “Straight hot,” as the un-pc would say, or perhaps skinny, blonde and femme would cover it. And… I wasn’t really that into her. But I wanted to hook up with her anyway because I thought it would make me awesome. I could like, casually drop that I’d hooked up with her to my male friends and blow their minds. And even if I never told anyone about it, I’d know I’d done it, and this would feel like being “successful” in some way.
I’m sorry to say, this has been a repeated feature of my sex life. Any time a “straight hot” blonde chick wants to hook up with me (which has maybe happened, like, 3 times) I *always* go for it, and I basically never get turned on. But I get such an ego boost from being asked that I roll with it.
And, part of what was creepy about that night, is that I was hooking up with that girl for social status, not to connect with her. Of course I was tuned out to what she was feeling sexually; I was completely numbing my own sexual desires in pursuit of ego gratification. I wanted the feelings of success that would come after hooking up with her, but wasn’t much interested in the feelings of connection that came during hooking up. I wanted to fuck her as quickly as possible and get it over with just so I could say that I’d done it.
This revelation helped me answer one of the most painful question that had been haunting me; how can men be sexually gratified by me when I’m hurting? How could my sexual assaulter have gotten any gratification from fingering me when I was so drunk I was blacking out? How could my ex come inside me after I told him I didn’t want to have sex? Why did people get angry with me when I asked to stop sexual activity that was hurting me?
How could people enjoy, and demand, being sexual with my body when they could knew it was hurting me?
The answer, I believe, is that they were in pursuit of ego gratification. They were disconnected from what we both were feeling, and were instead focused on the “accomplishment” of hooking up with me. The gratification they wanted wasn’t the gratification of connecting with another human, but rather achieving something in the eyes of society.
Understanding this helped me come to terms with my own feelings of worthlessness and unlovability. For so many years, I looked around at other people — other women — and asked myself, “what does she have that I don’t?” Why does someone love her, and why does no one loved me? And, I think these feelings were caused by the visceral experience of callousness, and at times anger and resentment, by my partners in what were supposed to be “the most” intimate moments of my life. Some part of me felt like there was something wrong with me that led to other people being cruel to me when they were supposed to be being nice to me.
But, when I remember that night with the pretty blonde girl, it’s now so easy to see there was nothing wrong with her. I don’t believe she was unlovable; just that, in that moment, I was so selfishly focused on my own ego that I was unable to show genuine affection for her. Even if I didn’t do anything to her without consent, I think what I did was bad for her. I think I hurt her. She would have sensed I wasn’t really into her when we were making out, and that probably added to her own feelings of worthlessness and unlovability. I did to her what so many men have done to me, and for that, I am truly sorry.
One thing that #metoo hasn’t addressed is — what do we do when we realize that we are the guilty party? What do we do when we remember incidents in our past when we weren’t as good to people as they really deserved? Because, well before we get to “illegal” sexual behaviors, there are a whole slew of “harmful” sexual behaviors which many (most?) of us are guilty of.
I feel somewhat frustrated with our current demonization sexual assaulters, because it reminds me of the way I kept telling myself “I’m not like Brad.” It reeks of societal denial. We pull out the worst, most over the top cases of high profile men who assaulted many victims over years, and demand justice without ever investigating our own culpability or participation in a corrupt system. We retain a comfortable ignorance of our own attitudes and own complicity by vilifying the most odious as we secretly assuring ourselves we’re not like them.
One of my male facebook friends noticed that nearly all his female friends were participating in #metoo, and he wondered; have most men participated in an act of harassment, or are a small number of men harassing a lot of women? He assumed it was most likely the later, an assumption backed up with these high profile cases that target many people.
However, I think most of us *have* participated in the culture of sexual harassment in one way or another. There is not a sharp divide between the “evil” men in the headlines and a mostly innocent public; rather there is a spectrum that we will all find ourselves on.
Common ways I believe many people participate and perpetuate sexual assault culture:
Objectification of women, and congratulating those who are sexual with conventionally attractive women.
Dismissing the pain caused by a sexual assault by examining the motivation of the perpetrator. The fact that I can relate to the motivations of the man who assaulted me doesn’t make my pain any less severe. A well intentioned miscommunication is not necessarily less painful than an intentional violation.
A focus on punishing perpetrators and celebrating their downfall rather than helping victims heal.
Not admitting the things we or our friends do wrong.
My main frustration with me too, is that it’s making #4 harder and harder. Ultimately, as a culture, we’re going to have to admit the things we have done wrong. We’re going to have to admit the mistakes we have made, and examine the causes and conditions that led us to make them. We’re going to have to own up to the pain we caused other people, and this is going to involve feeling the pain that comes with fully acknowledging how you have hurt people.
We’re going to have to stop pretending the sexual assaulters are out there, that they’re committed by horrible people with horrible minds and repulsive sexual urges. Sexual assault is a natural and obvious extension of our culture. It is a natural extension of values that we all have internalized.
And, we’re going to have to figure out what to do about that. Right now, we seem to punish assault by calling people out on social media, shaming them, and make them un-hirable (if we can’t arrest them.) But, are we going to do that to everyone? What about the people who only did it once, a long time ago? What about the people who are combinations of victims and perpetrators? What about the people who did things that are kind of sketchy, but not fully criminal?
Our current methods of correction can’t be applied to the entire population, yet our entire population is culpable in this problem (which, is why basically *all women* have experienced it.) We must stop trying to confirm our own innocence, but rather consider the ways that we’re contributing to the problem. Because this is a very difficult task, I recommend starting with the easiest questions.
Have you ever looked away, or dismissed, someone’s experience of sexual pain — even a little bit? Even just in your head? Even online?
Have you ever felt flattered by, or craved, the attention of conventionally attractive people that you weren’t personally actually attracted to?
Have you ever called women “hot” as a way of connecting with straight men?
Have you ever shamed non conventionally attractive people?
Have you ever shamed anyone for being sexually inexperienced or a virgin?
Have you ever shamed anyone for having non-standard sexual desires?
I’m guilty of most of these (at some time in my life) and usually because I wanted social acceptance. Part of what I try to do now is accept a wide variety of people socially, to help mitigate the conditions that would lead to them being cruel to other people. Truly fighting rape culture will require large changes across the board. It will require being nice to adolescent boys. It will require creating space for a non-sexual kind of femininity.
It will require a culture that grants basic respect and dignity to all people, just because they are people.

One of my kindred spirits, Peter Harrison, who I had the honor of being mentored by early in my teaching career, used to give out these insanely hard math problem sets. However, he encouraged students to get help from any teacher in the school — or even outside the school. You just couldn’t ask him.
Peter didn’t really care about the actual answer/solution. His goal — sly and subversive — was to have the math conversations exit the classroom and have a large as radius as possible.
Dammit. He just wanted people talking about math. He also created the most exquisite idea of bridging arithmetic to algebra back in the 80's — Cows In The Classroom. In the link, click on “Purpose and Rationale”. Below are the opening paragraphs.

Similarly, my recent Medium article was written to stir much needed discussion. To invite ideas/thoughts/perspectives from all the different/unique biographies that K to 12 math teachers bring to the table.
Agreement is fine. Disagreement is fine. Just don’t be quiet. That has been the Achilles Heel for math education to have any measurable effect beyond ripples in distant and isolated ponds. Oh, don’t get me wrong. People have tried to trigger mathematical tsunamis. Have they ever.

The intentions have been more than earnest and heartfelt. Yet, the shifts of change didn’t manifest measurably with the intended targets in terms of content. Classrooms, by and large, handcuffed by their own anachronism — sporadically checked — heard these lamentations like trees falling in a forest.
Meanwhile, on YouTube, mathematics was beginning to strut its feathers with channels like — Vi Hart, Numberphile, VSauce, etc. Having each over one million subscribers, these channels now dazzle and challenge viewers with some of the deepest and most wondrous ideas about mathematics freely — and joyfully.

Social media was the great emancipator of mathematics — not education.
You see, the greatest efforts of the greatest math leaders barely laid a dent in the Wall of math education — Roger Waters might not have been a math teacher, but he told millions about the machinery that would ensnare — and eventually emaciate — the heart and soul of mathematics. Staying with music and surfing the “wall” theme…Just replace “words” with “math”.

Mathematical Freedom Looks Like This
Part of the challenges of even wanting to contemplate something new is that teachers, generally speaking, are a conservative group, resistant to change. And, the long familiarity with even the most rigid and antiquated ideas about the math curriculum outweighs the possibility of discarding it all — and this is the destructive byproduct of the institutionalization of mathematics: math education becomes the dominant and accepted culture. Everything else becomes foreign and alien.
The tail(education) wags the dog(mathematics).
Schools(some) are nicer looking. Textbooks have glossier finishes. Social media connecting/learning has never been more fervent. That’s all nice. The problem is that the general culture/design of math curriculum seems dated — really dated.
I quit teaching in 2013 because I just got fed up with it all — the boring curriculum, the asinine emphasis on assessment, the lies, the deceit, and the lack of empathy/understanding for students who have to ingest such harrowing, disconnected pap. I tried, with my limited voice, to evoke even the discussion for change. Complete. Waste. Of. Time.
The math curriculum, already narrow in its scope, worships performance and practicality — and really unrealistic trig applications. The latter is tragically ironic, for in terms of trying to find authentic practicality, you might be better off collecting needles in haystacks.
The question below is one of my favorite math questions I have ever seen. But, not for the the reasons you might think. It’s so ridiculously stupid, that one might think that it was purposefully written to be nutzoid! A truck rambling down the highway at a clip of 170 mph, with the driver having the “observation” skills of a superhero, is more fascinated with a hovering object than road safety. Insert face palm. I don’t even have the patience to address the significant figures malfunction of the answer.

What Math Universe Allows This?
I agree that everyone needs mathematics and should have access to the highest quality of teaching and resources. I just happen to think that kids who played GO and Chess for 4 years in high school would be “better prepared” for the “real world” than dining on the cliched fare of polynomials, trig, and quadratic equations. They used to teach conic sections when I went to high school. I loved conic sections. But, good luck finding a curriculum that still teaches eccentricity and directrix.
Curriculum changes alright. But, I believe erosion moves faster.
I still think they should teach these things. I just don’t think they should be mandated after grade 8. There has to be other options for kids who desire to think mathematically, but might be getting turned off by the growing syntax, jargon, etc.
Classical mathematics should always have a place in high school, but jeez Louise, it is kind of time for a status update in 2018 to include more modern ways of thinking mathematically!
Also, as it has been mentioned many times, mathematics is a soulless sojourn without deep nods to its global history. Junaid Mubeen, co-editor with me at Q.E.D, summed it up all too well with Mathematics Without History is Soulless
But critiquing math education is a micro-audit activity. It operates in the larger antiquated mill of education. Sir Ken Robinson’s animated examination of the sifting/sorting/packaging/etc. students answered the bell on the macro picture of education.

My own personal lament is that the holy trinity of theories — number, graph, and game — are nowhere to be seen in most K to 12 math curricula. Prime numbers are merely a definition. Mathematical mavericks like Martin Gardner, John Conway, Ivan Moscovich, etc. are unknowns. Algebra pops out of a can in high school — with a sequel to boot. There is no organic and seamless bridge between arithmetic and algebra. Teaching algebra as an appendage to teenagers as opposed to teaching it as a circulatory system earlier on is one of the clearest indicators of the mismanagement of mathematics by education. It’s like going to hardware store. Aisle 3, top shelf: nails, washers, and Algebra I.
Mathematical expectation, one of the most powerful math concepts — that can be learned by almost anyone in the time it take to boil an egg — remains relegated in upper level high school courses. Logarithms, exponents themselves, are mysteriously separated from exponents by sometimes as much as three years. Etcetera.
Sorry. Tweak this and tweak that never worked — only for publishing companies. It all has to come down. Decimals on Monday. Fractions on Tuesday. Kids identifying math by where they are in the textbook — I am on 7.3 — and just general, isolating soup can delivery of math has to stop. It is kind of insane — and accepted(which makes it more insane)And, for some, fear of the unknown/what to do will be natural reactions. That is okay.
Now…to the drawing board…literally.
Early this year, Daniel Torres-Rangel, a kindred math spirit I met at NCTM 2016 in San Francisco, and I had some rough ruminations about what a “fantasy” K to 12 math curriculum would look like. We started with some broad ideas, filled in some holes, and asked others to join our mission.
Below are some screen shots of the Google document.

I always envied English teachers. They always seemed to have more flexibility in choosing the books we read. Shouldn’t math teachers have the same autonomy to choose their favorite math topics/problems? I mean, the brain isn’t partitioned by math topics. There is no lobe/hemisphere that is starving for the double-angle trig formulas. The brain simply wants its axons and synapses firing and blood flowing like a raging river — maybe, we should just have kids doing Suduko and its variants for 12 years.
At least give teachers/local school communities the space/respect to create their own K to 12 math curriculum — or at least temper it.
I am unclear how someone can love mathematics so much and watch it suffer in cramped cages, fed a constant diet of tests/assessment, and orchestrated with bureaucratic agendas — especially since it has been rightfully assailed for the better part of this century.
I can think of no better way to end this than with Lockhart…and a few choice words for the soul crushing bureaucracy that still chokes the bloody life out of mathematics.

                '20': '''They say beauty is in the eye of the beholder. And for the most part it is, I’ve never been one to believe that beauty played a major role in whether you can maintain a relationship. Like attracts like. With marriage and relationships, they aren’t reserved to the most beautiful of us, though it can help.
Being attractive, as studies have shown, can help in many different ways. Attractive people are considered funnier, more likable, and smarter than Plain Jane or Joe Shmoe, regardless of whether those attributes are true or not.
This boost in perception is often called pretty privilege, the belief that attractiveness can open doors and better treatment.
There are all types of privilege- white privilege, male privilege, rich privilege etc. But pretty privilege is unique in that any gender, race, ethnicity can have it. Some people don’t even know they have it since beauty can be subjective. I spent many years being confused and didn’t know I was considered pretty. If you look in the mirror too many times, you start to see the flaws.
But pretty privilege has an expiration date. Most enjoy this privilege from their late teens to their early 30s, some are blessed to have it even longer.
And when you think about it, pretty privilege gives an advantage for certain jobs like make up artists, instagram models, dancers, actors, hairdressers and any sales positions, etc. First impressions are everything. When you’re going to a job interview the first thing a person knows about you is how you look. That could set the mood for the whole interview and even determine whether you get the job.
I really understood how powerful pretty privilege was when I was helping two supermodels find an apartment. They were in their early 20s and looking for an apartment in East Village, NYC. Talk about a trendy place to live. They were gorgeous people. These women were incredibly beautiful, tall and svelte; I could see why they were super models. One of them did runway shows for fashion week in Paris and the other had a campaign with Gucci. There’s no better example of how pretty privilege can truly change your life because these two women made so much money, more than I will make in half my career. High six figures kind of money, just to take pictures and be beautiful, not to mention all the free stuff they got from the designers and free food they get on set. It seemed like an amazing lifestyle and all based on their beauty and attractiveness. Personality-wise these girls were like anyone else. They were introverted, nice enough, and friendly. Yet I felt drawn to get to know them better, helping out these top models was so cool!
My own experience with pretty privilege was not nearly as all-encompassing. I was actually a very ugly child; scrawny, short, and kind of man-ish. It wasn’t until my late teens and early 20s that I realized that I was conventionally attractive. Youth seems to do that to people, you’ll see older people bring out their photos of when they were young and it’s like wow I can’t believe they used to look like that! That was me in my early 20s, sort of blossoming.
Initially, it felt a bit awkward to have men and even women want to get to know me based on nothing but my appearance. I was conventionally beautiful, but because I was an ugly child for what seemed like a lifetime, the attention seemed fake and false as a young adult. Where were these people when I was plain? I used to try and make friends and it didn’t work since I wasn’t as attractive, now all of a sudden I was interesting to people.
Over the years, people’s kindness became more normal to me. I recognized that had I been less attractive I probably wouldn’t get the same amount of attention, but I figured I might as well take advantage while I can. Youth only happens once.
Things people would do that they probably wouldn’t have had I remained unattractive:
1. Give me seats on public transportation when its standing room only.
2. Free food: sometimes as an add on to what I ordered.
3. Free drinks.
4. VIP admission to clubs.
5. Offered to study with me in college (I wasn’t particularly smart or outgoing)
6.. Buy me stuff from small trinkets to tickets to shows.
The attention was really intense from 19–24, then started to level off at 24 after I married, and definitely has leveled off at 30.
Over time I realized that being considered pretty did have some pitfalls. It’s hard to be pretty. It was hard to feel close to other women, there was a sense of competition from them and sometimes jealousy. It was also hard to know whether someone was being really generous out of the kindness of their heart or whether it came from a place of attraction. After a while, I just started to assume attraction was the motivation for male kindness; I had met too many men who held expectations in return.
Beauty is also fleeting. I always knew that and never had my self-esteem tied with my outward appearance. Now that I’m 30, it’s clear to me that my most beautiful days are behind me.
Everyone in this world gets older; they get a little more tired, they get wrinkles and their hair starts to gray.
And though good looks last only a while, it’s taught me to value my other qualities and aspects of my personality above my physical appearance.
Pretty privilege is a gift that you might’ve been given, no different from being born to the right family or in the right country. But just like any other opportunity, it’s what you make out of it that counts. And though it lasts only a short time, a lot can be done in those years you’re considered most beautiful. So consider your beauty a gift, whatever beauty you have, and seize the day to build a future ahead.

                '21': '''I’ve been asking you to be more considerate of what you do & don’t say to me. But this conversation doesn’t end there. Today, I’m asking you to examine and question the ways in which the world is set up to shame and exclude fat people. To make us feel like our character, intellect, dignity, worthiness and humanity are all less-than because of the shape of our skin.
That system is called fatphobia. It ensures that there is always someone there to remind us that we are seen first as fat, which means we are always seen as weak-willed, piteous, cautionary tales.
Sometimes the reminder comes from news footage of fat people, faceless and filmed surreptitiously, reduced to the shape and size of our bodies, silent effigies worthy of pity, shaming, lecturing, but no voice. When we are allowed to speak, we appear on shows like the Biggest Loser, a show dedicated to showing thin people berating, belittling and shaming fat people.
Image for post
From the brilliant Jes Baker’s campaign to challenge weight hate.
Sometimes the reminder comes from strangers who stare, laugh or shout when we walk down the street. Grocery shoppers who offer unsolicited advice or condescending “good for you!”s. Men who gawk at the gym, or call names. Well-meaning family members who share before and after pictures at every chance, tell us we’ve got “such a pretty face,” and if we only lost twenty pounds…
Sometimes the reminder comes from you, my wonderful, bright, brilliant friend. Despite your warm heartedness and support in so many other areas, when I talk about what I face as a fat person. You are quick to dismiss what’s happened as a fact of life that can’t be remedied, disrupted or even empathized with. Often, you step more readily into the perspective of anonymous strangers, doctors, airline passengers, ad executives, bosses, dates. You are quicker to defend strangers and systems than you are to relate to your friend. It’s a sharp turn in our otherwise friendly conversations.
One of the most heartbreaking things about fatphobia is the way it burrows into our brains, hijacking our values and distorting our sense of self. Most of us think we’re fat, but none of us want to be. So, in order to hear my experience, you might have to wade through the heartbreak, frustration and shame of how you feel about your own body. I am asking you to do that, bravely and vulnerably, because we will both be stronger for taking a long look this system of beliefs, attitudes, policies and practices that trap all of us.
Fatphobia keeps us in an endless cycle of dissatisfaction, frustration and shame. It keeps us from focusing on our happiness, and keeps us fixated on an impossible standard for our bodies. It tells us that we can only start living our lives when our bodies are smaller. It demands that we make ourselves thinner and thinner, shrinking ourselves endlessly — and who among us feels thin enough?
Fatphobia keeps us spending money on miracle cures, supplements, diet books, exercise equipment. It keeps us from getting healthy, and keeps us focused on getting thin. It insists that you can tell how healthy, moral, hardworking and emotionally stable someone is just by looking at them. It keeps us feeling inadequate, afraid, disempowered, and ashamed.
Fatphobia tells us that we have to get small at all costs. It doesn’t care how many diets, medical programs, exercise regimens we’ve tried. It doesn’t care what we eat, how much we exercise, or even who we are. It insists on explanations for the size of our bodies, and none are good enough. Fatphobia demands that getting thin is our sole focus; that our bodies will never be small enough; that we sacrifice everything at the altar of weight loss.
If you are thin, this is disordered thinking. If you are fat, this is demanded of you. It is the price of living in the world with a fat body.
Fatphobia is an orthodoxy that leaves no room for any alternative perspectives. It is not a democracy, not consensus. Fatphobia is totalitarian. It keeps me just as trapped as sexism, homophobia, and the other systems of oppression that impact me every day. If I’m honest, the way people treat me as a fat person has a more immediate, deep impact than the way people treat me as a woman or a queer person.
It’s always difficult and vulnerable to talk about our bodies. When I talk about being fat, and being treated like a fat person, I can feel my ribcage cracking open. Here is my heart, slick and beating, my lungs and their bellowing silver skin. I am presenting you with my bare skin and the vital, tender things underneath in the hope that you will see something human and recognizable in me. Because any brokenness in me isn’t any greater than any brokenness in you. The difference is in how we’re treated.
I’ve asked you to practice some common decency, and think about how what you say impacts the fat friends and family you love so dearly. Now I’m asking you to grapple with the way you’ve been trained to see the world. Think through with what you’ve believed about fat people in general, and what those harsh and unforgiving beliefs mean when you apply them to me, the flesh-and-blood friend you’ve known for so long.
Think about your standards for how all people should be treated, regardless of what they look like. Take a close look at when and whether fat people are allowed to qualify for that basic standard of dignity, respect and acceptance. Look at the way the world is set up, and look at your own ways of thinking about fatness. Let your love of specific fat friends and family propel you through questioning your beliefs about fat people in general. Love us enough to think differently.

                '22': '''7 years ago, I did something I thought was unimaginable when I started teaching in 1994 — I quit. In 2017, Canada’s largest newspaper let me tell an abbreviated version of that story.
Looking back at that decision and that story, I realized that the bottom-line of my decision was based on the deep belief that mathematics that I was forced to teach in school and hence, forced to test, was completely devoid of any humanity.
The list below is the minimum standard for humanizing mathematics. It’s not also what we bring to the table, its what we discard from the table — the wholly deleterious performance culture of K to 12 mathematics.

Most of my teaching career was in a sterilized vacuum, where implementing ideas like the ones above were challenging and really a test for echo. And, while I applaud the list above for highlighting so many required ideas to make mathematics more human, it doesn’t address the pink elephant in the room which contributes to why math education is not human — testing.
Until you get rid of testing and evaluation — negative cousins of assessment (which is critical to student learning)— mathematics will never be human. Testing, always paired with speed, another buzzkill for humanizing mathematics, only exists to label, sort, and repeat. Kind of like shampoo, rinse, and repeat. Testing also doesn’t care about statistical validity. It just wants to data. It’s a form of control. To control education and to control mathematics. It is then sold in accountability jars to anyone who cares for such things — administrators, politicians, and naive parents.
Testing also limits the creativity and rigor that can be taught. Most good math questions I gave my senior high school math students had deadline dates of at least a week, sometimes a month. What kind of questions can you ask on 20 minute quizzes or 2 hour exams? Simple content and/or questions that have been done to death during the year. I call that pedagogically lazy and philosophically bland. What tastes better? Homemade pies sold at a Farmer’s Markets or those sold by the thousands by some large company? I also want to purchase from the person who created the pie with their ideas of baking,etc.
But, math education has never been about humanity — even though that has been the real narrative of mathematics for thousands of years. The humanness of mathematics has been almost surgically excised, leaving only a body of work to be picked over, rummaged through, and artificially assembled without coherence and historical context.
Ladies and gentlemen, I give you the standard K-12 math curriculum which, outside of calculus and statistics, peaks around 9th century India — of course without ever mentioning that. Considering that a bulk of mathematics is taught through a eurocentric lens, that just seems ridiculously ironic, if not tragically laughable.
But, math education has never really been about personalizing the story of mathematics outside of margin-sized, black-and-white photos of mostly white, male mathematicians.
Mathematics in schools is about performance, usually in on-demand forms like exams and standardized tests — kind of like a seal spinning a ball on its nose, but without the fun of spinning a ball on your nose.
There is one new idea for humanizing mathematics that came to me via my affirming and buoyant conversation with Berkeley Everett, who will be going back to California next year to start a K to 5 Math Specialist position in Los Angeles.

In our one hour conversation, which unintentionally flowed in and out of making mathematics a most human endeavor, Berkeley said something which I had NEVER thought about. I mean I have brushed up against what he said with ideas that we shouldn’t try to get students good at math — more like inspire them. He took it one step further. He said our society turns every hobby, past time, and interest, into a competition and full-blown immersion for the purposes of full-blown mastery. Collectively, we asked, “why does everything, including math, need so much demand to be an expert?”.
Why can’t people just dabble in mathematics, siphoning off all cliched expectations and inert standardization?
Berkeley’s background is a classical/jazz pianist. That’s right, like me, he doesn’t come from a math background. To which he added, we need these two elements in math education: curiosity and vulnerability.
Speaking of music, last week I came across a wonderful, little video documenting the musical collaboration between Nancy Wilson(Heart) and Eric Tessmer — two of my favorite guitarists/musicians. All the musicians are sitting loosely in circle, creatively discussion ideas about putting song together. There’s no wrong ideas. It’s just a free-thought, brainstorming session, infused with an obvious love for music. In parts of the video, Nancy Wilson laments current technological modalities in song construction, which allow for artists to not even be in the same room. Towards the end, she really taps into the humanness of making music.
Math is no different. Yet.

This is the essence of how music was created — before it started losing its humanity. Brian Eno even says the music itself, wrongly seeking perfection, has lost its humanity.

Circling back to curiosity and vulnerability. Are not these two of the highest qualities to be human? But, math education will never reform itself without these allusions of humanness.
If it does, it will be an illusion.
If we are in the throes of rehumanizing, rethinking, and rebuilding math education, then what we are asking — but not asking with enough directness and conviction — is that we need to let this anachronistic model of a curriculum of cheap, mathematical scraps that derives its inflated currency from standardized tests, sink to the bottom.
If you are going to use the word “disruptive” in math education, then you sure as hell better be not signing up for some diluted definition to be co-opted and sold to keep the ship afloat. We already have too much off that.
Eight years ago, Dan Meyer said “Math Class Needs A Makeover”. What he really was saying, to me at least, that “Math Education Needs A Do-Over”.
To be truly serious about humanizing mathematics means to start from understanding that, wanting that, and slowly constructing that…however long it takes.
So, that maybe one day, we just sit in circles, openly discussion math problems, sharing strategies, going off tangent once in a while, and making sure that the identity of each student is known and valued.

                '23': '''When you lose a friendship, you face a unique kind of rejection.
Unlike in romantic relationships, where the lines of commitment are often clearly defined, definitely broken, or completely removed, friendship exists in a place that both seems less important than romance, and yet in many cases, far more intimate. When we are rejected by a potential partner, we understand it’s part of the game of dating. When we are rejected by a friend or group, oftentimes we’re far more bereft. These are the people with whom we have shared far more honest and authentic pieces of ourselves. The pain from losing a friendship can often run far deeper, and last much longer.
This is only amplified by the fact that we often don’t get closure.
Whereas we have to define the beginning and end of a romantic relationship, friendships tend to break and fade over time. Sometimes, we simply stop talking to someone and are afraid to be the next one to reach out. Sometimes, we just can’t get our plans aligned and are left wondering if life is really this busy or we’re both avoiding one other. Sometimes, our lives stop running congruent to one another, and we discover our bond was really through circumstance, and nothing greater. Sometimes, we stop having enough in common to make the effort worthwhile. Sometimes, we stop being the people we once were, and our relationship shifts alongside that.
There’s a really particular sting that comes with the fear that your former friends might secretly hate you. Every time you see a Instagram story in which everyone is tagged but you, or a Facebook album of a party you didn’t know about, a tag on a meme page about a joke that isn’t yours, a wedding website with a bridal party that doesn’t include your name — it hurts. It hurts because you didn’t know where you stood and now you do. It hurts because you can imagine these people making these plans consciously and likewise for whatever reason, consciously deciding to not include you.
You should know that this kind of hurt is legitimate — far more legitimate than most people will ever tell you.
You should also know that this is how it’s supposed to be.
The problem is just that you’re now seeing what was once invisible.
You’re supposed to outgrow people.
You’re supposed to let go of some people in order to find others.
The honest truth is that you are not for everyone, and everyone is not for you. This isn’t because you’re unworthy of being in their presence, but because you’re simply mismatched. In the same way that being rejected from a romantic relationship isn’t so much a testament to your inferiority, but rather, a sign that you weren’t properly paired with a partner that could walk alongside you on your path in life, being rejected from a friendship is the same.
You don’t need to develop a complex because some people don’t want to hang out with you. You don’t need to interpret their actions as a sign that you’re a social recluse, someone deeply undesired and cut out. You do need to understand that it is normal, and healthy, to phase through certain friendships, and personalizing and ascribing intent to that natural process is what’s causing you so much pain.
In the past, friendships would end and you weren’t faced with constant updates of those people’s lives. Now, you are. Now, you’re connected to them in a way that no human beings ever have been before.
Instead of naturally growing into the people we’re meant to be, we hold onto our old identities and try to bridge them all together. We try to be a piece of what we imagine each person in our lives wants us to be, and the weight of trying to be everything, all at once, breaks us slowly. Because we aren’t supposed to carry all of this. We are only supposed to show up as we are today. Authenticity is the only avenue through which true connection can form.
You’re not supposed to see those nights out that you weren’t invited to.
You’re not supposed to have to witness an ongoing feed of photos and videos that serve as nothing but a reminder of what you weren’t included in.
You are not entitled to be part of every plan someone makes, even if you consider them your friend.
Your friends are allowed to do things without you.
They are allowed to move on.
You are, too.
The point isn’t that you should just get over it, but that in place of developing a lifelong complex, please recognize that you are supposed to outgrow some friendships. Not everyone is here for a lifetime, and not everyone can walk a path that aligns with yours.
The faster you accept that this is true, the easier you can let go, and find the people who are ready to walk with you toward where you’re heading next.
Though lifelong friends are invaluable gems, the truth is that it is okay to catch up with your childhood pals only a few times a year. The truth is that it is okay to not need to see every detail of their lives as it unfolds. The truth is that you can hold space and love for all the people with whom you’ve shared happy times in your life, while acknowledging the bittersweet fact that life sometimes carries us in different directions, and that’s not because we aren’t right for each other, but because we are meant for something different.
Real friendship is allowing each other to grow.
It’s waving from the shores as you say thank you for everything they’ve meant to you, and wishing them love as they pursue what they are meant for next.
It’s not about deciding who is or isn’t worthy, who is or isn’t at fault, who is or isn’t calling enough, including enough, and so on.
It’s about understanding that friendship, like so much in life, is best when its effortless. You didn’t have to make a concerted effort to see the people you loved most when you were most in love with them, it happened naturally. When it doesn't, there’s a reason, and that reason isn’t your perceived unworthiness.
It’s growth.
It’s time.
It’s progression.
It’s that you are becoming different people in different places with different responsibilities.
Love is not holding on so tightly that nobody can ever move on. It’s allowing the people we love to move forward, even if sometimes, that path doesn’t include us.

                '24': '''ike most American women, I’ve been prepared to defend myself against sexual assault and rape. I know to “never take your eye off your drink” and “don’t walk alone at night” and “if you have to, put your key between your fingers to use as a weapon.” Even as a kid, I was taught not to talk to adult men I didn’t know. The message has been very clear: There are predators out there ready to take advantage of you, so be alert and prepared.
I’ve taken my role of self-protector seriously. I learned self-defense moves from a friend training to be a cop and felt ready to take down an assailant no matter their size or if they had a weapon. A therapist I worked with taught me to repeat the numbers “911” so I wouldn’t forget in an emergency. It sounds silly, but she said I’d be shocked at the number of people who get distraught and dial “411,” the number for local directory assistance.
Despite the years of effort and preparation, when I was sexually assaulted in 2005, I did not defend myself. I did not use my key as a weapon. I did not disarm the weapon he held against my neck. I did not dial 911. I didn’t even scream or move. I froze and complied.
The people who had guided and instructed me on how to respond to an assault neglected to explain how my body and mind would respond. I don’t blame them, because they didn’t know. In a practical sense, it’s true that training can prepare people to defend themselves and escape, but when it comes to cognitive functions, it’s not a given. And most people have no clue how the brain functions because basic neuroscience isn’t a core curriculum.
Understanding how the brain responds to emotional stimuli like fear would have saved me over a decade of guilt and anxiety.
To graduate high school in most U.S. states, you must understand cellular respiration, the sexual anatomy of a flower, and how to calculate the hydrogen ion concentration for a strong acid, but you don’t need to understand what controls your ability to function as a healthy, happy, well-rounded person.
Understanding how the brain responds to emotional stimuli like fear would have saved me over a decade of guilt and anxiety. It might or might not have allowed me to respond any differently to my assault, but it certainly would have changed how I felt about my response to it. In fact, it would have changed the entire narrative surrounding the event — things like victim-blaming and fear of reporting.
When society expects you to say no and defend yourself and you spend your life training to protect yourself but then you comply during an assault, you’re left with immense shame and devastating guilt about how your body responded. But imagine a police officer, a judge, or a victims’ hotline advocate with an understanding of how the brain really functions during trauma. We’d live in a world far more compassionate about how survivors actually react during assaults.
In offering a scientific explanation of why I froze during my assault and smiled afterward, I’m hoping to help people — whether they’ve been assaulted or not — understand why this response is so common. And I want those who have been assaulted to feel less alone and have less shame.
During My Sexual Assault, I Froze Up
Trigger warning: details of sexual assault
During my senior year of college, I directed a low-budget, one-act play. To fund the production, I approached local businesses to ask if they wanted to purchase program advertisements and asked my friends to recommend locally-owned businesses where they had a connection. Some sorority members heard about my request and raved to me about a salon owner down the street from the school. “He’s the best!” they said. “He cuts everyone’s hair in the sorority. You’re going to love him! Book an appointment with him!”
I called the salon owner, told him about my production, and asked if I could set up an appointment to discuss advertising. He agreed to discuss it over a haircut, which he said he’d give me a great discount on.
The following week, I arrived at the salon and was surprised to see it completely empty of customers and hairdressers, except for one frustrated stylist cleaning her station and the owner. The owner led me to his chair and draped a cutting gown around my shoulders. In the mirror in front of me, I saw the stylist roll her eyes and leave. The tension between them was apparent, but what concerned me most was that I was then completely alone with someone I didn’t really know anything about.
The owner followed the stylist as she left and locked the salon’s front door behind her. He came back and began to cut my hair. There was something aggressive about his presence, the type of feeling you get around a sleazy guy who will do anything to get what he wants — a used-car salesman vibe. He didn’t ask how I wanted my hair cut or styled and instead went at it with an attitude of “I know what will look good on you. You don’t.”
As my hair fell on the cutting gown, he wiped it off. It was a peculiar gesture that gave me pause. I tried to remember all my haircuts in the past. Had other stylists brushed the hair off my gown too? I couldn’t recall a time when they did. His touch became more persistent and began to gravitate further down my body to my neck, my shoulders, my chest, and then my breast.
I interrogated myself harshly: “Why didn’t you leave? Why didn’t you scream?”
I kept asking myself, “Is he doing what I think he’s doing? Is he purposely touching my breast?” At first, I convinced myself that I was so small-chested that he just wasn’t aware of where his hand was landing. I continued to stare at myself in the mirror, the image of a broad man behind me, his pelvis resting against the back of the chair.
Before I had time to process what was happening, he paused from cutting my hair. He rested the sharp shears in his right hand against the base of my neck. His left hand continued to brush the cutting gown. There was no hair left on the gown, but he persisted. He worked his hand slowly down the front of the gown, groping my breasts several times before moving down toward my stomach, my thighs, and in between my legs. The gown prevented him from making full contact with my genitals, but he swept his hand along that area several times, applying pressure in the spots where the gown made contact with my body. His body was still pressed against the back of the chair, his chest pressing against my head.
I continued to sit, frozen, smiling politely, witnessing the assault in the mirror, feeling the cold metal of the sharp shears against my neck. It was a matter of minutes, but it felt eternal. When he was satisfied, he finished cutting my hair and told me the price. We never discussed the advertisement he’d said he’d wanted to purchase. I reached in my bag, handed him cash, smiled, said “thank you,” and walked to the door, which he unlocked, allowing me to leave.
When I got in my car, I was still frozen, mechanical, cold. It wasn’t until I drove away that I returned to myself and began to cry hysterically. At my house, I crawled into my bathtub and shivered and cried for hours. My mind played out the scene over and over again — his hands on my body, the heat of his body against mine, me giving him money and thanking him.
I interrogated myself harshly: “Why didn’t you leave? Why didn’t you scream? Why didn’t you take the scissors out of his hand and threaten him? Why did you pay him? Why did you thank him? Why didn’t you just tell him to stop?”
Believing fight or flight is our only response to threatening situations makes it easy to victim-blame.
Part of me felt like a victim, part of me felt like an idiot, and part of me wanted justice. I listened to that part. I called a local rape and sexual assault hotline and told them, in detail, what happened. I told them I had never filed a police report before or accused anyone of a crime and that I was 21 and needed some help. The response the advocate gave me triggered the same powerless feelings I felt in the salon chair. She said, “There’s nothing you can do. There were no witnesses, and you have no evidence. You could file a police report, but they won’t do anything about it except ask for his side of the story. They have no reason to believe you.”
I was infuriated and devastated. I called some close family members and told them what had happened; they only echoed what the advocate had said. The next day, I had a rehearsal for my play. I told everyone in the cast and crew. They were sympathetic but also didn’t have any advice about what actions I could take.
Every time someone confirmed what the rape advocate told me, I heard a voice that said, “You allowed this to happen. You let it happen.”
I imagined what would have happened if I had fought back: “Would he have tried to hurt me? That would have been evidence, right? If I had screamed and someone had heard me, they would be a witness, right? What if I had kicked him in the nuts on the way out? That would have been a defense, right?” Every scenario that conjured evidence and witnesses was in my hands, based on my actions. But my action during the assault had been to remain still and politely smile, to allow him to do what he wanted with my body. Why?
The Brain’s Responses to Threats Are Complicated
Most people know the phrase “fight or flight.” We’ve come to rely on it as an explanation for our behavior in times of high stress. The idea was first introduced by Walter B. Cannon in 1915. He observed that provoked animals released adrenaline, which gave their body the extra energy it needed to escape from or attack their predators. He proposed that human bodies work the exact same way. In some ways, he was right, but we’ve made many advancements and discoveries in the past century that shed light on our very complex response to stress. It turns out that humans don’t just run or fight when they’re scared.
I propose we get rid of this phrase entirely. It’s a false idea about instinct.
Believing fight or flight is our only response to threatening situations makes it easy to victim-blame. It becomes natural to think that if we’re only programmed to fight or run away, then anyone who doesn’t clearly wasn’t very threatened. What scientists and psychologists now understand is that the brain has a very intricate system of self-preservation. The first line of defense at certain times is not to immediately pump adrenaline but to slow down the prefrontal cortex.
Think of your brain like an electric grid. During a survival situation, you don’t lose total power to your prefrontal cortex — the area of the brain responsible for higher cognitive functions like decision-making, planning, and communicating emotion — but it does start to run on backup generators with certain non-essential functions shut down to conserve energy.
My prefrontal cortex was offline, and I didn’t have a choice to express my emotions because my brain had redirected power from that system.
This means when you’re faced with a threatening situation, you lose power to the part of your brain that can help you consciously decide what you should do next, understand how the situation will affect your future, make a detailed or complex escape plan, or tell your abuser that you’re not okay. It can happen instantly and often without your control. A different response can be re-trained, but it takes more than people just telling you to defend yourself when the time comes.
The brain takes that extra power to energize other parts deemed more necessary for survival, like the amygdala, which we have no conscious control over. It receives input from various parts of the brain and then sends action signals to other parts. It’s like middle management with tenure. When your amygdala receives the input that you’re in a threatening situation, it sends out the troops as necessary. But it does far more than just trigger adrenaline; it works in tandem with the hippocampus to assess the type of threat and respond in the most appropriate way. The hippocampus is your functional memory bank — the intelligent data storage the amygdala pulls from to figure out if it’s got a security protocol already in place for the type of threat.
Depending on the threat assessment, several things can happen in your brain and body, and this is why the oversimplicity of the fight or flight response is an outdated way of thinking. It’s possible you will be flooded with superhero levels of adrenaline that make you physically stronger and faster than you’ve ever been in your life. It’s also possible that your brain will see no way out and then activate your parasympathetic nervous system, which decreases heart rate and muscle tone, effectively freezing you in place.
And if you’ve ever had a similar threatening experience, your amygdala and hippocampus might deploy a remembered security protocol you previously created to cope that involves fawning, complying, or even laughing. These reactions are typically built up over time by people who experienced trauma as a child. Their brains have developed incredibly clever systems to appease abusers and avoid life-threatening situations.
Complying — and Even Smiling — Doesn’t Mean Assault Is Okay
I was abused at a very early age by a trusted figure. To survive that situation, I had to “be a good girl.” My brain developed a very smart fawning system that allowed me to protect myself by appeasing my abuser. I was not in control of this programming nor was I able to make the conscious decision to choose otherwise.
When I sat down in the salon chair in an empty locked room with sharp scissors against my neck, my brain didn’t give me the option to fight back. I was at the mercy of my programming — which meant I froze, smiled, and politely left before getting in my car and breaking down.
My prefrontal cortex was offline, and I didn’t have a choice to express my emotions because my brain had redirected power from that system. My parasympathetic nervous system weakened my muscles and decreased my blood flow to such an extreme that I was not able to physically move or respond. In that moment, I was the same little girl who had been abused before with the survival memory of “be a good girl.”
My silence was not consent, nor was the fake smile smeared across my face. Paying my abuser for my haircut and thanking him as I walked out the door was not an approval or forgiveness of his actions. It was survival programming, and it doesn’t make me weak or him any less guilty.
We cannot continue to rely on outdated assumptions about how people should respond to threatening situations. It’s imperative that we teach ourselves and others how the brain works, especially during moments of trauma and survival. Victim-blaming and shaming must end. We’re smarter and better than this.''',
                '25': '''I grew up camping in the Pacific Northwest. From the chilly, Oregon Coast, to the deep sapphire waters of the Puget Sound, my summers were filled with exploring the wonders of the west coast and the waters next to it. However, as I recall my beloved childhood summers, I realized something: I never saw Black people at the campgrounds.
The easy answer for this, often from the Black community has been “Black people don’t go camping, that’s a white people thing.” However, I find this answer unsatisfactory. Black people do plenty of things that White people enjoy. Historically, the only reason we do not do things often perceived as White is because we were banned from participating in that space.
Camping is no exception. The racist policies that aimed to bar Black people from participating in this national past time established camping, and the great outdoors, as White spaces. In short, s’mores and campfires weren’t meant for us.
It has always been easy to rent a camping spot, if you are White. The process usually involves a short application, a one time payment, vehicle registration, and then a polite introduction to the campground keeper when you arrive.
When I was a child, my White father always handled these interactions, easily securing our spot among the west coast trees and ferns. We were able to quickly set up camp and have our feet up by the fire within a couple hours of arrival. No one came over to politely question the presence of my White parents and I, only gazing from the distance with curiosity.
My parents’ Whiteness was an unexpected pass key into a White space. By being their child, my presence was not questioned. However, this had not been the experience for most Black Americans.

Shenandoah Valley from Pixabay by 12019
In her piece, Shenandoah National Park Is Confronting Its History, writer Kathryn Miles explores the national park’s dark history of segregation. While Lewis Mountain, a portion of the park, was created for Black visitors, Miles notes that, “…it was nonetheless understood that the rest of the park would remain the sole purview of white visitors.” Shenandoah is one of America’s most iconic parks, but despite belonging to the people of the United States, until 1950, it belonged to White Americans. Black Americans were allowed to participate in their own space, but full free access was denied.
The experience of segregated camping was not limited to Virginia. Out west, Black Coloradans could only find solace in nature at Lincoln Hills, a resort that welcomed those with melanin. Across the nation, camping was only allowed with other Black people, but not with White counterparts. Camping was an activity where Black people were allowed to participate, but never given full license to sit around a campfire with marshmallows and hot dogs. They had to be invited.
Segregation is key to understanding not just camping, but also the experience that went around it. By being segregated, Black people would not necessarily be able to enjoy the other parts of camping that make it an engaging experience: hiking, canoeing, and taking part in other adventures. (If you are regulated to a certain part of the park, it may not have all the services available.) For example renting a canoe for an afternoon on the lake may have been an easy experience for a White family, but for a Black family they could have been easily denied service by a company or had prices raised for the same experience. Outside of the stress of finding a campground where one could spend the nights, Black people had to also deal with the exhaustion of entertaining themselves and staying safe.
Segregation cemented camping as an activity for White Americans; it was something that they were encouraged to do with uninhibited access and freedoms. Their presence in nature was never to be questioned and camp sites, national parks, and other outdoor venues happily catered to their desires while placing limitations on Black adventurers. This inferred ownership of the outdoors and camping that has been carefully protected by White people.
As noted by Miles, in 1994, the National Parks Service experienced White backlash when they openly supported diversity in the national parks, receiving a letter to the editor of National Parks Magazine, from a anonymous author who anxiously stated, “If minorities do not like going to the parks, it is their loss. But please don’t let us be duped into thinking it is our loss. Many of us look to the parks as an escape from the problems ethnic and minorities create. Please don’t modify our parks to destroy our oasis.” The letter is a White plea to maintain the national parks as a haven where White people did not have to deal with the experiences or sights of minorities. Ironically, White people fled to stolen indigenous lands to be removed from any interaction with people who carried melanin in their skin. The 1994 letter also reinforces a key detail about the outdoors: desegregation of campgrounds did not end the the exclusion of Black people from participating in camping. It created a standard.
It is easy to see why a Black presence in a campground may be perceived as threatening. Aside from racist beliefs, it also has to do with perceptions of wealth. Black prosperity has always made White anxiety run wild. Camping is no exception in this regard as it has been an activity that demonstrates White wealth.
I remember my father proudly showing off our camping gear to house guests, or discussing our camping adventures to friends. While sharing the joys of a hobby, it was also a demonstration of our family’s economic ability, a keeping up with the Jones commentary for the middle class Americans.
“With the knowledge that camping was a segregated activity, and is one that is a billboard for White prosperity, it is no surprise that Black participation is instantly perceived as a threat.”
If you want to go camping, you should be ready to invest in quality goods. On the cheap end, a tent from REI for four people will cost $99, with more expensive tents setting the buyer back $920. When you factor in other costs like food, a grill to cook on, camping ground fees, etc., camping becomes an expense that only families with expendable dollars can afford. While camping becomes more affordable once you have bought the key items the fact remains that you need money to enjoy the great outdoors. In this way, camping has become a symbol of leisure within our culture. This relationship with wealth, along with the history of segregation, has created a space that is unwelcoming to Black people.

With the knowledge that camping was a segregated activity, and is one that is a billboard for White prosperity, it is no surprise that Black participation is instantly perceived as a threat. Today, the push against Black people entering a space of White symbolic wealth is still actively happening. In 2019, a Black couple in Mississippi was held at gunpoint by a White campground manager who accused them of illegally trespassing. More recently, this year, a biracial family was harassed by campground owners who told them “their kind” was not welcomed. In both cases, the presence of Black people was grounds for verbal and physical threats by campground managers/owners. The message was clear: this place is not for you, it was never meant for you; leave.
The battle for equality does not stop in the streets of Seattle, Portland or Minneapolis; it is also happening in the campgrounds of America.
Black people do not have a natural aversion to camping or the great outdoors; we have a natural aversion to racism and abuse. We don’t go camping because we hate mosquitoes, need heated rooms, or hate campfires, we don’t go camping because the industry has not been welcoming.
The first step towards seeing more diverse campgrounds is create welcoming environments for Black campers. One key way is to assure that our national parks and state parks are diverse spaces. This can be done with hiring diverse Park rangers, campground managers, and park employees who are representative of American society. Having diverse employees means that Black visitors to parks and campgrounds will be treated with the welcoming nature that White guests have always been given. By seeing people of our background in leadership positions at parks and in campgrounds, Black people will feel safe and be more likely to buy that tent at REI.

The second step is companies in the camping industry taking initiative to promote diverse leadership. Companies that own campgrounds, cabins, and RV parks along with those that provide local adventure experiences can also hire diverse employees who can assure the camping spaces are welcoming lodging destinations. In the same manner as the national and state parks, the presence of people that look like us signals we are in a safe place. Putting up signs that say “Black Lives Matter” are nice, but companies must show actions by supporting local diverse communities.
Outdoors segregation is part of our national history, but should not influence our present, especially in a time when camping may be one of the best ways we can enjoy socially distanced vacations.
Black people deserve to have fun, to go into nature and stretch out by a campfire and cook s’mores. However, for Black people to be welcomed into camping spaces requires White awareness of past inequalities that linger in our current outdoors culture. Black people want to explore our country, and younger generations are beginning to wander into the woods. One way or another, our presence must be respected.
August 13: Updated to include more of an explanation of how segregation would have barred Black people from taking part in camping related activities. Added link to E&E article I found today that relates to this topic.

                '26': '''There’s a lot of well-meaning people out there posting in response to the deaths of Kate Spade and Anthony Bourdain, who both died by suicide this week. We are easily devastated in our culture when popular, well-loved, well-known folks choose to remove themselves from the planet. It’s OK to be hurt, sad and angry. I feel it, too.
I’ve been able to tell, sort of, who in my feeds has not experienced depression, suicide ideation, and the spectrum of emotions and/or mood disorders along those lines, because I see a lot of these posts:
“You are loved.”
“If you need someone to reach out to, I’m here.”
“Please reach out if you’re having these thoughts.”
I get what you’re going for here, and the intention is genuine and very needed. However, may I suggest some alternative deployments of that intention?
By no means are all experiences in this end of the world the same, but I’d like to share what it feels like on the inside looking out for many of us who swim in the dark waters. I’m also including thoughts and experiences that friends shared on my original Facebook post about this subject. I’m by no means a mental health professional, here, either, just someone who’s been working with my own depression and anxiety for 20+ years, so that’s my lens.
Often the person who is struggling can’t reach out. When I drop down, I drop out. A common experience in my depressive episodes, until 5 years ago, was a disastrous cocktail of not knowing that what I was experiencing was abnormal (I thought I just couldn’t handle life like everyone else does) and extreme shame about that. I didn’t know to send out a flare or reach out, mostly, and when I did, I’d downplay my symptoms to my friends. I was in therapy for years and didn’t report symptoms, too, because I honestly didn’t know that other people didn’t experience the world the way I did.
Therefore, it’s up to you to notice when something is off — when you haven’t heard from someone in a while, or when you see them posting things that give you a red-flag-tingle. Does that feel awkward? Yep. Do you fear it sounds like you’re overreacting? Sure. But what’s the worst that can happen if you poke the person who’s hurting? More on potential downsides in a second, but the point here is, community care is on you, not the people needing the care.
Here’s a real world example of what that that could look like. I was having a real hard time in early May with the aftermath of several #MeToo revelations in progressive political communities, and had been coming down off my own experience sharing my complicated story on This American Life. I took to Twitter to emote, and just wanted to curl up and hide. Then @Atrios sent me a direct message:

This did so much for me in that moment — it took the sharp edges off what I was feeling. I was still feeling hurt, but a tiny bit of the despair was aleviated. What was it about this? Duncan was human here. He said he didn’t know what to say, but he noticed my posts, made a couple funnies, and most importantly, he didn’t put it on me to relieve him of his concern with that second message. This is a good model to follow.
3. That’s the main point I want to hit with how you decide to reach out. Make sure the person knows that your worry is not their problem. This is NOT about you. I’m always reminded of the Silk Ring Theory of comfort here — comfort the afflicted person, and then share your own hurts and needs with people less affected by the situation than you are.

4. Ditch the passive voice. Seriously. Saying “You are loved” is not only impersonal — “no one in particular, but someone might have nice feelings for you!” — but it can hit that craptastic note I mentioned above. People suffering an acute emotional crisis might feel their pain is causing loved ones’ pain, and that hurts even more. Vicious cycle stuff. And ideation often isn’t the result of feeling unloved, it’s an acute and dangerous response to wanting to relieve yourself from extreme pain, and feeling like you have no other way to do so. (This doesn’t account for people with disorders that involve voices telling them to do harmful things, and other illnesses that inspire suicide ideation, I know.) In my experience, I didn’t want to stay on the planet if being here meant pain, plain and simple.

5. Consider putting preemptive systems into place with your close homies. Don’t wait for your peeps who struggle with emotional wellness to do this, either. Start now. One big thing that’s changed a lot of circumstances for me is a texting system my heterosexual life partner, Cyn, and I started doing a couple years ago. We both happily live on our own, and at various times in our life, we’re either single or non-traditionally partnered. Both of us fear having a New York death (where something happens to you and no one finds you for days and your pets have eaten your face), and Cyn was having particularly acute anxiety after losing a friend to sudden death in the night. We agreed that we’d text each other every single morning, and that there were agreed-upon sets of actions we’d take if we didn’t hear from one another. We’ve done it every day since, and having that structure has shifted a lot for me. Both the task itself and knowing that someone who loves me and gets me without judgement will both notice and take action if I’m not OK gives me a welcome toehold on reality.
And the system’s original intention works, by the way — there was one time my technology was messing up, and I hadn’t heard from Cyn by our agreed-upon time. I started texting and calling her friends at work by noon or so, and was ready to call her neighbors to check on her. I finally got one of her messages that was like, “Um, settle down, I’m in a meeting…” We laughed ourselves silly. It feels good to know people are going to show up. Overreacting with burden-free, guilt-free, shame-free love can be OK.
6. Lastly, for my fellow swimmers of the dark waters: Oh man, I’m with you. I’m so with you. This world is just… I don’t even know what to say about it right now. If it’s helpful, my friends and I built a free little tool to help folks reach out and share difficult stuff; it’s called The Weather Report. What I like most about it is that it has a place for you to say what you do and don’t need right now. Yesssssssss.''',
                '27': ''' Sapiosexual, a relatively uncommon word, refers to a person who is strongly attracted to intelligence, over and above all else.
Self Discovery
I didn’t even know the term ‘sapiosexual’ exists when I started dating the guy whom I thought was the smartest person I’d ever met. I was like a little kid tasting cotton candy for the first time, indulging in the sweet tingling sensation dating a new species of homosapien. My eyes sparkled, my sense of awe triggered, my dopamine flushed when I was immersed in deep conversation with him. It was a fascinating new experience to date a knowledgeable person, while i was comfortably being the geek I am.
If an intelligent being saw me as equal – that said something about me, didn’t it?
Making myself smaller
He got busier as his new venture took off. It was what Uncle Ben said in Spiderman series, ‘with great power comes great responsibility’. I learnt to compromise and be contented to see him once in a week or two. Sometimes, I even only saw him once a month. While he kept me in his life by sending sweet brainy texts, I became good at spending time on my own. I told myself it was okay that I will never be his number one, and he was doing bigger things that would change the world.
I put myself in a lose-lose relationship. But I was too proud of the fact that I had an intelligent partner, so I told myself everything was OK.
Energy draining
During the days of his absence, I was drowning in questions that never get answered: ‘Is this relationship normal? Where is this heading?’ I used to think that we had special ‘remote’ model because we were both extraordinary people with a purpose in life. Then the validity of remoteness started to creep into my head and drain my energy. At the lowest point of doubts, I cried at night staring at the phone. I knew that he was merely a phone call away, but I could not pick it up and dial his number – he must have something important on his mind if he never reaches out.
This question hovered in my head again and again, ‘do I love him or the idea of him?’
Break up
Then came the day he told me he had to let me go. It was a huge blow to my ego. I remembered watching sunset by his side thinking that everything was perfect. The most beautiful moments that we shared turned out to be things that hurt the most in the end. Somehow it was funny how life worked – the process of recovering wasn’t hard because he left little trace in my life. My favourite places were intact and I didn’t have much of a chance to show him off to friends and family.
As time goes by, I was thankful that he made the call so that I can focus on building my life.
Hindsight
Despite a bitter sweet journey, a sapiosexual relationship opened new windows in my life as he connected me to new things and people.
Through all doubts I connected deeper with my inner self. Why was I submissive to his pattern? Why couldn’t I communicate openly about my needs? Why did I always let him dictate when we should meet?
One day I had an ‘aha’ moment that made me jumped right up in the chair. I realised I didn’t think I was enough!
Even though I always thought I was perfectly capable of taking care of myself, I was not secure in my own skin to acknowledge that I was enough and I needed the identity of ‘sapiosexual’ to convince myself that I deserve a smart, capable partner. I was feeding on his ‘greatness’ to extend my own greatness.
Why do you need to be a sapiosexual when everyone is seeking for universal ‘love’ that is beautiful and complete on its own? How do you define intelligence?
A healthy relationship has universal characteristics – it requires commitment, deep communication, alignment in lifestyle and value in order to provide fertile soil for both persons to thrive together.
You have to know that you are beautiful enough, smart enough, happy enough, worthy enough, complete enough; stay true and be proud of yourself.
When you feel complete and beautiful from inside out, trust that the universe will conspire to bring that great person with sharp mind and beautiful heart to your life.''',

We lost Anthony Bourdain last week. I never met Anthony Bourdain. I saw him a lot on television. And he was important to me. He was important to me because he was a humanist. Someone who spent his time attempting to show us that not only are the people on this planet a lot alike, but the parts of us that are different are wonderful too. Anthony Bourdain was important to a lot of us. Because we need humanists right now. We need people to show us the best parts of ourselves. Anthony Bourdain was especially important to me because he was a self-admitted flawed humanist. Anthony Bourdain was Mister Rogers if Mister Rogers had spent his 20s doing heroin and banging waitresses in the walk-in freezer.

“Walk in someone else’s shoes. Or at least eat their food.” — Anthony Bourdain
We needed both of them, and I loved both of them, but with my own fucked-up past I knew that Mister Rogers’ path was closed to me, but Bourdain had opened a path I could still follow. For personal selfish reasons, I needed and loved him a little bit more.
We’ve lost one of the last of the humanists. And I’ll miss him. But since I have no idea what was going on in his head, I’ll stop talking about him now. I don’t want to make assumptions about what was going on in his brain. I’ll leave that work to those who personally knew and loved him. We lost a celebrity. They lost family.
What I want to talk about today is how we deal with suicide. And it’s going to get personal, because that’s the only way I can talk about it with any authority whatsoever.

If suicide is a sin, God is an asshole
As a kid, I was told that suicide was a sin. I was told this by men whose own broken brains told them it was acceptable to diddle young boys who’d just helped them say mass. And were I still a Catholic I might still be alright thinking of suicide as a sin, albeit a sin of the maker. I’d question a God that made defective products, and then blamed the user when the product broke. That’s a sin. Trust me, it’s not easy to grow up hearing that God loves you, gave you broken brain, and if you can’t deal it’s your fault and you’ll go to hell. And hearing this from an authority figure whose breath stinks of your classmates stolen childhood is particularly fucked.
If you’re cool with God, please rest assure that I have no intention about making you feel uncool with God. You take your support where you can find it and you do you. My issue is with religions that blame you for your chosen divinity’s own shitty worksmanship. I have to believe that if God were real, he wouldn’t be a total asshole, and I often wonder why religions feel a need to paint their objects of devotion as shitty parents.
So, no, suicide is not a sin. But blaming people for losing a battle with mental illness might be.
When you hear that people “struggle with depression” I want you to know that struggle is the most real word in that sentence.
Suicide is not selfish
As an adult I’ve had to deal with the suicide of more than one family member. Their stories are their own and the point of this essay isn’t to rehash them, sensationalize them, try to make sense of them, or reopen the wounds of those still dealing with the loss. But after almost every one of those suicides, and after every suicide that makes the news and gets discussed on social media, someone will utter a version of “what a selfish thing to do” or “why didn’t they think of their family” or “they had everything going for them.” And while I’m not one to harsh on how people do their mourning, let’s get one thing perfectly clear:
Suicide isn’t something you do to other people.
Suicide isn’t even something you do to yourself.
Suicide is something your broken brain does to you.
I’ve struggled with depression my entire life. My brain is broken. It lies to me. It’s a hostile organ in my body. I can’t live without my brain, but it’s also really fucking hard to live with it. It makes me believe things that aren’t actually true. It digs through my psyche, which it has full access to, and pulls out my deepest fears and shows them to me every single morning. And so far, so far… I’ve been able to win that daily battle. Some days I emerge a little bloodier than others. But there’ve been a few days where I was lucky to make it to the next day. Lucky.
When you hear that people “struggle with depression” I want you to know that struggle is the most real word in that sentence. Every day can be a fight. And every morning that struggle starts again. Someone who has to wake up and fight 365 days a year isn’t selfish, they’re exhausted.
And all it takes is one slip. Sometimes your brain tells you a really good lie. Sometimes, as is happening now, what’s happening in the outside world compounds what’s going on inside your head. Sometimes your brain uses that information to its advantage so you stop watching the news so your brain doesn’t have ammo to use against you. Sometimes your brain, and this one is especially fucked, convinces you you’re doing so well you can probably stop taking your medication!
Suicide is not giving up, it is not a selfish act. It is losing a long awful battle with your own mind. But please respect that person fought every day. Every day.
Mental health is a human right
About ten years ago I made a commitment to therapy. For five of those years I went every week, and then once I was “out of the woods” we cut it down to every two weeks. A couple of years ago my therapist moved out of the city. (Once therapists can’t afford San Francisco rent you can no longer deny there’s a problem.) She and I made a deal that if I was in trouble I would call. A few months ago I called. I felt the warning signs of depression coming down the road. From a ways off. That’s a skill I wouldn’t have without therapy.
Here’s the thing about therapy: It didn’t cure me. It didn’t fix my brain. And it didn’t make my brain stop lying to me. But slowly, over time, and with a little medication, it gave me the tools to dismiss the lies. And it gave me the tools to see when it was mounting an offensive. We should all have access to those tools and the people who help us build them.
I’m a privileged jerk who has access to therapy and chemistry. Many people don’t. Depression affects people regardless of how much money you make. You can’t buy your way to happiness, but you can buy your way to care. Walk around any major city in America and you’ll see hundreds of people struggling with mental health issues who don’t have access to the care and services they need. (We don’t have a homeless problem. We have a compassion problem.)
Mental health is a human right.
Also, I was lucky, or smart, or whatever, enough to walk away from the stigma that I grew up with around depression being a sin, or a weakness. You can no easier choose to magically get over depression than you can choose to magically mend a broken arm. Both take professional care. I was 40 years old before I made that therapy appointment. Because I grew up in shame. I grew up being told that my mental illness was a character flaw. A weakness. “Man up!” I was told, because let’s go ahead and add some machismo bullshit to that stew. Last March NBA player Kevin Love published a piece on his own mental illness, and I love that he did that, and it’s important that he did that, because it helps cut through that macho bullshit.
You learn what it takes to “be a man.” It’s like a playbook: Be strong. Don’t talk about your feelings. Get through it on your own. — Kevin Love
Dealing with mental health is a sign of strength. Don’t let anyone tell you otherwise.

No one commits suicide
The people I know who’ve chosen to end their life have not committed suicide. They lost a battle with their broken hostile brains. Commitment implies a choice. You commit to a healthy diet, you commit to riding your bike more, you commit to giving Father John Misty a try. And obviously, you can, if you choose, commit murder.
But we can all agree that it’s odd to look at a murder victim and say they committed death.
Depression is your broken brain killing you. The person whose life is over is as responsible for that murder as any other murder victim. They committed nothing. They were killed.
The current preferred nomenclature among mental health professionals is to use suicide as a verb, as in “Bob suicided”, rather than “Bob committed suicide.” Society as a whole will keep saying the latter for a while. Change takes time. As well-meaning as that change is, I still don’t think it goes far enough. “Bob suicided” still implies that Bob made a decision, when in reality Bob was the victim of multiple things: a broken brain, belief systems that perpetuate victim-blaming, a society that stigmatizes mental illness, and medical care systems that don’t give people the access to the treatment they need to fight the disease they were born with. In reality, we take the decision away from people.
No one commits suicide. But we, as a society, are complicit in not getting people the help they need. We need to be better. As Mister Rogers taught us, “Look for the helpers.” But some of these people are looking for helpers, and not finding them.

                '29': '''Are we living in a simulation?
The question seems to be gaining in popularity this year, the 20th anniversary of the release of the most popular incarnation of the simulation hypothesis, the iconic movie, The Matrix. Just this week, a new sequel, called The Matrix 4 for now, was announced with stars Keanu Reeves and Carrie-Anne Moss reprising their roles.
Philosophy professor Preston Greene recently wrote an op-ed in the New York Times proposing that if we are in a simulation, it is better not to find out. I disagree.
First some background. Today’s versions of the simulation hypothesis are based on our recent advances in video game technology. Oxford professor Nick Bostrom popularized the idea in his 2003 paper, “Are You Living In a Computer Simulation?” Since then, Elon Musk, among many others, have advocated for this argument, which claims that if any civilization can ever get to the Simulation Point (the technological ability to create a virtual world as realistic as the physical world), then it’s probably already happened.
This means that there are probably many more simulated beings in virtual worlds than there are “real” beings in base reality. After all, the simulators can just ramp up a new server and create a billion more simulated beings. Since there would presumably be no simple way to tell whether you’re a simulated being or a “real” one, sheer numbers would suggest we are more likely to be inside a simulation than not. This line of reasoning is broadly referred to as the simulation argument, and it’s what led Musk to speculate the odds we are not in a simulation is “one in billions.”
But this concept is really the modern equivalent of a very old idea. It goes back thousands of years to Plato’s Cave and the Eastern religions, such as Buddhism and Hinduism, which explicitly put forth the idea that we are living in an illusory world called maya. The concept is also tied to the Judeo-Christian religions, which tell us that our good and bad deeds inside this world are being watched by “recording angels,” and we will be judged based on a viewing of these after death.
Today, not only is our video game technology getting good enough that we might be capable of building our own simulated worlds soon, but our scientists and technologists are proposing new experiments and interpreting findings of existing experiments that reveal that we may, in fact, already be in a simulation.
Should this research be pursued aggressively?
The implications of the simulation hypothesis stretch well beyond any one field, which is why philosophers, scientists, technologists, and theologians are all weighing in on this important question. We should take all of these perspectives seriously when considering whether we should pursue research into whether or not we’re in a simulation.
First, is it even possible to figure out whether we are in a simulation?
Some have argued that the simulation hypothesis is non-falsifiable, meaning it can’t be disproved definitively. Thus, it isn’t “scientific” at all and should just be ignored. However, simply because something can’t be proven wrong doesn’t mean we can’t find evidence that it is true. Once upon a time, scientists thought that meteorites that fell from the sky were mythological, based only on anecdotal evidence. The prevailing model of reality at the time didn’t allow for this possibility — and therefore they insisted that this phenomenon did not exist. Eventually, in addition to the anecdotal stories of rocks falling from the sky, scientists found hard evidence, which eventually led them to change their model of how the universe works. Like all paradigm shifts, it took many years before this new model was accepted as better conforming to reality.
A number of researchers, including Nobel prize-winning physicist George Smoot and Stanford’s Leonard Susskind, believe that physics is already showing us evidence through quantum effects that we are in a simulation. In my book, The Simulation Hypothesis, I argue that unexplainable quantum phenomena (notably quantum indeterminacy and quantum entanglement) don’t make sense in a material world, but they make much more sense when viewed through the model of a simulated, information-based world. Other physicists believe that the pixelated nature of space, and potentially, time, both lend credence to the idea that we are in a computer engine-based simulation.
Former NASA physicist Tom Campbell, along with Caltech’s Houman Owhadi, proposed a series of experiments based on quantum phenomenon that would prove that we are in a video game-like reality. They raised money on Kickstarter and I was fortunate to see the beginnings of these experiments, already underway. The experiments attempt to show that one of the biggest mysteries of quantum physics, the observer effect, requires a conscious observer, and not just a measurement device. The conclusion is meant to demonstrate that the physical world is only rendered when there is a “player” observing it, as in a video game. Famous hacker George Hotz (founder of self-driving car company Comma.ai) gave a controversial presentation at SXSW where he suggested that we try to “hack” out of the simulation. YCombinator’s Sam Altman said that he knew of several billionaires who were funding their own ways to hack the simulation.
Given how quickly this concept is progressing, it’s possible that within a decade, we’ll be able to find hard evidence that we are living inside a simulation.
This brings us back to the question of whether we should.
Greene’s argument was really a technological version of Pascal’s wager: even if you’re not sure if there is a God, it’s better to behave as if there is, just in case you’re wrong. Greene argued that if we are in a simulation it could be a research project, and research projects rely on the subjects not knowing about the research. If we were to do experiments and show that we were in a simulation, the simulators might shut us down! In that case, it’s better not to find out, since it could result in the shutdown of our civilization and world. Nick Bostrom, who popularized the simulation argument, also has expressed reservations about trying to prove we are in a simulation, because the simulators may not like it.
A related question I’ve been asked often since my book came out is why we should care if we are in a simulation? Although the reasoning here is different than Greene’s wager (in this version, since it makes no difference to my life, why bother?) the conclusion is the same: it’s better not to know.
I think the answer to this question is contained within an overlooked aspect of simulation theory. Namely, that there are two versions of the simulation hypothesis that can best be understood through the lens of video games.
1. The NPC version. In one version, all of the entities inside the simulation (that would be us, btw) are actually like nonplayer characters (called NPCs) in video games — simulated artificial characters who do not exist outside of the game. Bostrom’s simulation argument relies on the fact that there would be many more of these than “real” beings in the base reality that launched the first simulation. Smoot estimated that the ratio of simulated to real beings could be as high as 10¹² to 1.
2. The RPG Version. In this version, which is the model suggested by the world’s religions, we exist as conscious entities outside of the simulation and are simply playing a “role” or taking on an “avatar” (we might call it a “body”) inside the simulated world. This is not unlike the situation in the Matrix: Neo (Keanu Reeves) and Morpheus (Laurence Fishburne) both existed outside of the simulation and inside the simulation.
These two versions aren’t mutually exclusive. A video game like World of Warcraft, for example, has both player characters as well as NPCs. But it brings us to an important, if not well-understood, aspect of our existence, what NYU’s David Chalmers called “the hard problem of consciousness.” It stands at the crux of why this isn’t just a scientific question, but one that affects philosophy and religion as well.
If we are RPG characters in a simulation, that means that most of us exist as conscious entities outside the simulation already.
Whether we are NPCs in a simulation run on a computer, or role-playing entities actively participating in the simulation, makes a very big difference in whether we should proceed with this research.
If we are NPCs inside a game only, then there may be restrictions that prevent us from understanding that we are inside a video game. In this scenario, if we did discover we were in a simulation and the simulators did not want us to know, they could simply “rewind” the simulation and erase those memories, instead of shutting it all down.
In fact, if we assume we’re in an NPC simulation then we can also assume this has probably already happened, perhaps more than once — we just don’t remember it.
Yet, we are still here, so this by itself doesn’t mean that the simulation won’t be able to continue. Philip K. Dick believed that this has already happened multiple times and wrote his novel, The Man In the High Castle, because he claimed to have remembered an alternate timeline where the Nazis won WWII, a timeline that was “rewound” by the simulators.
If we are RPG characters in a simulation, that means that most of us exist as conscious entities outside the simulation already. As in The Matrix, we’re unaware of this fact because the simulation is so good that it’s indistinguishable from reality. Like Neo and Morpheus, shutting down the simulation would simply mean “waking up” from the delusion.
Here’s why it makes sense to find out if we’re in a simulation, looked at through several different lenses:
The RPG/video game argument. If we look at it through the lens of a video game, every modern game has achievements and quests to guide the character. Understanding that you’re in a game is a first step to understanding how to achieve the desired results of the game. If we are inside a game like Grand Theft Auto, for example vs. Fortnite, the things that our characters do next would be radically different. While the nature of the game and the corresponding achievements is unclear at the moment, learning we are in the game would be the first step to focusing on the “right” outcomes. In fact, the point of the whole game might be to see whether we can recognize we are inside it.
The Matrix argument. If we are inside an RPG like The Matrix, then not only will we not stop existing, but we may be able to escape the simulators. If we are in a simulation, we might be slaves to some master race, and the first step to freeing ourselves would be to know that we are inside a game. In this context, “ending the simulation” would be the desired result, as opposed to “continuing the simulation.”
The religious argument. In a reversal of The Matrix argument, and in-line with the video game argument, most of the world’s religions express the idea that we are here for a purpose and that we are being monitored and recorded (via karma in the Eastern traditions and the Book of Life and the Scroll of Deeds in Christianity, Judaism, and Islam). Knowing that we are inside the game would not end the game. In fact, you might argue that all of the world’s religions started because someone peeked outside the simulation and came back to tell us what the nature of the game is. This not only did not end the game, but enhanced it for those players still to come.
The science argument. The goal of science is to understand the nature of the world around us. Discovering the rules of physics may in fact be just discovering the rules of the physics engine which governs our simulation. Science has, in some ways, abandoned the big questions of why we are here and why things work as they do. In my book, I argue that the reason we are baffled by quantum phenomenon is that we don’t understand their purpose or context, but the simulation hypothesis provides a framework for why things work the way they do. The entire goal of all science may, in fact, be to determine if we are in a simulation or not. In this case, it doesn’t make sense to not pursue scientific research of this question.
Although I could expand on each of these arguments, I think they collectively express the reasons why we should proceed with simulation research. The goals of religion, science, and philosophy are more similar than each field might admit: to understand the nature of the world around us.
Finding out if we are in a simulation is the crucial question that underlies all of these fields and might be the only way for all of these fields to advance and truly understand reality.
So, when it comes to doing experiments to figure out if we are in a simulation, I say: Full speed ahead!''',
                '30': '''Note: The suspected push back from the usual suspects in the math community has already occurred.

Teaches herself mathematics with a cat-and-mouse game with her strict and disapproving father. Takes on pseudonym of Monsieur de Blanc to get lecture notes from Lagrange. Work eventually catches eye of Gauss, who has his own potential entanglement with Napoleon's forces. Germain reveals female identity to Gauss. Gauss merely writes the most beautiful letter to another mathematician.

We have had a few uncomfortable conversations regarding race/equity in math education. Notably, Rochelle Gutierrez’s strong assertion that white privilege is inherently tied to how mathematics is presented and valued in society. I am also aware of how viciously she was attacked on social media for her views — which, oblivious to the attackers, only underscored that there was indeed a problem with race/equity in math education.
But, the echo chamber of math education is rather large, and every revolutionary thought is eventually devoured by it, relegating it to the ash heap of “thought of the day”. I mean, what happened with this story. Is math education guilty or not guilty of the things Gutierrez cited quite strongly and passionately? I heard lots of support for Gutierrez in the math community, but I didn’t hear a lot of support for her ideas.
That is the difference. Many math educators were strong enough to stand with her. Few were strong enough to actually champion her ideas and put their names beside it.
I am not going to ramp it back up to where Gutierrez took the conversation. I am going to throttle it down to just saying that math education suffers from not so much being “too white’ —which can sound negative and more of a sensationalist sound bite — but from completely ignoring the global color/texture of the history of mathematics.
One of the most successful World Cups wrapped up in Russia earlier this month. For those of you who do not follow soccer, the British announcers are not only the best soccer announcers in the world. They are the best announcers in the world. Period. They pronounce the names of every single soccer player — from all the different nations — perfectly…and enthusiastically.
Before you read anymore of this article, watch and listen to the clip below. While the heart of every announcer knows the pain of English soccer and how a nation aches to relive the joy of 1966, the last time England won the World Cup, they always realize that soccer is bigger than one nation — that it is truly world spectacle that brings all of us together every four years. The excitement that is shared by the English announcer for Colombia when they tied England is beyond evident — it channels a spirit for seeing the beauty and emotion of this truly global sport.

Emotion and empathy are generally absent in math education. As such, so is the rich history of mathematics. As such, so are the beautiful details and colors of mathematics.
The predominant color of mathematics is…(cue sarcastic drum roll)…white.
In the top picture is the mathematician, Aryabhatta. Very few students would know who he is. Regrettably, there wouldn’t be too many teachers either. Ironically, millions of high school math students intersect his discoveries when they explore trigonometry or quadratic equations. Why do we not reference his work? Where are the the enthusiastic commentators in mathematics who champion the global importance of mathematics as they do soccer? Do they only save their voice for the cliched Canon of Greek and Western European Mathematics only? Most of the high school curriculum is, in a nutshell, 9th century Indo-Vedic mathematics — save calculus and statistics.
Of course, Rochelle Gutierrez was right. But, as piercing as her words were, if they just become part of the news cycle of mathematics, then we are going nowhere — fast.
So much volume, especially on social media, is taken up by math pedagogy. Great. Wonderful. But, if the pedagogy disregards math history — and all the cultures that contributed to it — then it is also disregarding mathematics. It is distorting the story of mathematics and it communicates to students that mathematics is an inert body of knowledge, created perhaps by aliens, and left in some hermetically sealed chamber to be discovered by white explorers.

If math history is not organically woven into the fabric of any K to 12 curriculum, then math education will suffer the only fate it deserves — disconnected irrelevance. We spend countless hours worrying about kids understanding fractions — to this day, I am still completely flummoxed by that — and close to no time folding in math history. Somehow ensuring kids can add fractions with denominators nobody cares about is more important than humanizing math education with the hundreds of artists — spanning every culture/civilization on the planet — that have contributed to its creation?
Image for post
Every important musician or artist of our time knows the history of its craft. Every important band from the UK — The Beatles, Rolling Stones, Led Zeppelin, The Who — was a walking encyclopedia of early American Blues.
So why is mathematics suspended in such a cold and lifeless state? Well, that was answered last decade by Paul Lockhart, and like Gutierrez, his voice drowned and got lost in that large echo chamber of inert ideas.
Image for post
So, yes, carry on math education. Ignore the outside world. Ignore the fact that any adult wanting to learn mathematics now — especially interesting mathematics, doesn’t need you, as sites like Numberphile(which incorporate math history) are taking care of that. Ignore the fact that critical books like The Shallows and Slow have alerted the world that how we are learning and interacting with the world is not healthy.
Image for post
But, this all a symptom of the larger problem, that math education — filled with great educators — still refuses to give them a curriculum that is relevant and colorful. It’s like giving great cooks a crappy pantry and poor cuts of meat and asking to make wonderful culinary dishes. For a time, yes, their creativity will work. But, eventually, it is going to turn into an exercise in trying to make silk purse from a sow’s ear — or, beef bourguignon with Sloppy Joe.
I am not sure who the tsar’s of math education are. Eventually, the trail leads to the doors of government. But, they should be aware of the fact that the idea of mathematics being “white” will continue to be true until there is an honest and concerted effort to let students and teachers know that mathematics didn’t begin with Pythagorus and end with Newton. Perhaps, in the end, they just don’t bloody care. Because, maybe in the end, math education is just big business — and having references to brown folks with weird names is not good for business.
The ironic part is, the business model of math education — not listening to the outside world — is how the final chapters of Blockbuster and Sears were written.
Math education doesn’t need a new chapter. It needs a new book. I would suggest starting here…''',
                '31': '''Here’s a belief I hold: What we consider reality is, most likely, a sensory rendering of a fractional slice of true reality, which is probably some computational network entity much like a laptop’s CPU or the neural network of a human brain.
My belief is close, but not identical, to the “simulation theory” Elon Musk popularized. Rather than believing we are necessarily living in some simulated video game programmed by a more advanced version of ourselves, I think our reality is probably something like a computer’s screen, and true reality is probably something like a computer’s processor — and I doubt that either the “screen” or the “processor” were made to be like a video game. In fact, I doubt they were made by anyone or anything. True reality, I believe, is something only a highly advanced algorithm could understand.
Here’s my problem: I have no idea what to do with this belief.
I believe it. I really do. There are many others who believe it (or something like it) too. But for some reason, it has near-zero effect on how I go about my daily life.
This conclusion I’ve reached should be life-altering. I literally think our reality is a tiny bit on a giant computer chip. Yet my approach to life is no different: I still spend lots of time on Instagram. I still want good grades. I still want validation from others. I’m still worried about my career. I still want to be seen as attractive. I still want to make lots of money. I still want to find true love. I still want my life to be some great, big, beautiful story with a happy, fulfilled, regretless ending.
In other words, even though my understanding of life has drastically changed, my execution of life remains staggeringly unaltered.
Now, compare my belief to that of a newly converted Catholic. With conversion comes a change in lifestyle, values, habits, perhaps dress, diet, hobbies, and so on. From Judaism to Buddhism to Islam, each religion entails a certain belief about “true reality” as well as a set of cultural habits and values. To be a Catholic, simply believing that Jesus was the son of God doesn’t cut it. You have to adopt a certain way of life, align your daily actions with your ideology, understand why those daily actions are important, and participate in a community of like-minded believers. That’s why we call Catholicism a “religion” and not a “theory” — through taking action as part of a community, Catholics demonstrate that their beliefs run deeper than mere conjecture.
On the other hand, we refer to the “simulation theory” and not the “simulation religion” because it’s totally bankrupt of ideology. It offers its believers nothing beyond an answer to the question of what true reality is. It lacks an identity, a community, a set of values, a leader — its name even sucks. Further, it’s hard to clearly define the belief itself. The first paragraph of this article was my best attempt at summarizing what I believe, and I know for a fact I did a shitty job of it. I even researched if my belief had a name, and the best I found was a philosophy called pancomputationalism. If someone asked me my religion, I might say I’m a capital-P “Pancomputationalist,” but even then I’d seem at best a nutcase and at worst a douche.
How could believing that fundamental reality is a network of computer signals improve our lives?
What’s most disappointing is that lots of people hold a similar belief, but they’re not easy to find. There is no Simulationist Mecca nor Pancomputationalist garb. There is no structured community at all, barring perhaps the comment sections of a handful of YouTube videos or a series of Reddit pages. So of course my lifestyle hasn’t changed. I have no guidance — be it a code of ethics, a moral leader, or otherwise.
In public life, this lack of structured community shows. There is not a single openly atheist member of the U.S. congress. Why? Because who the hell would vote for someone who doesn’t believe in anything? Meanwhile, at least 28% of the U.S. population doesn’t believe in God. Where’s our representation? Ah, that’s right — we don’t have an identity. And when you don’t have an identity, there is nothing to represent.
It’s time atheists start taking initiative just like other religions. What would an atheist, simulationist, and/or pancomputationalist church look like? Would it be a scientific research center that’s open to the public? Or a VR experience that offers a temporary escape for unhappy people? Who are our leaders? Elon Musk? Nick Bostrom? What about our values? If life is a simulation, what makes life worth living? How could believing that fundamental reality is a network of computer signals improve our lives?
Perhaps if I had these religious devices, my life would change in accordance with my beliefs. I might think harder about what makes me happy. I might draw new, profound meaning from my existence. I might care less about pleasing people. I might place less value on making money, and more value on the study of life itself — physics, philosophy, the natural sciences. The culture and community of organized religion opens doors to endless opportunity — but for whatever reason, we are reluctant to open them. Some atheists probably think they’re “above” religion, in which case I will gladly dissociate from them.
I invite those of you who are compassionate, curious, reasonable, self-aware, and who at the same time believe God does not exist and that reality might be a rendering/simulation, to form a community. Let’s figure out what makes life worth living and write it down. Let’s meet at a sacred location to talk about it. Let’s find a leader who can help us define a code of ethics. Let’s offer up legitimately helpful religious guidance to misplaced, disaffected, and unhappy people.
As “scientific” as our beliefs about a simulated reality may seem, they are still beliefs. It’s time we treated them that way.''',

Algorithms are hidden from most of us, yet they are shaping many aspects of our lives — and they perpetuate systemic racism.
To understand how this happens, and how we can correct it, we turn to Yeshimabeit Milner, a data scientist, social entrepreneur, and Ashoka Fellow. In 2016, Yeshi started Data 4 Black Lives, a community of mathematicians, tech experts, and changemakers who are using data and movement-building as tools for a more equitable world. Ashoka’s Konstanze Frischen spoke with Yeshi this week. Here are our highlights:
An early spark to find solutions
Yeshi grew up in Miami, the daughter of a single immigrant mother. School was a refuge for her, but in high school, fellow students witnessed a vice principal put a student, a 14-year-old, in a chokehold. In response, students organized protests, and Yeshi joined in. She shares what happened next, when they asked themselves: “Beyond protests, what can we do?”

A case study in encoded bias: credit scores
Like algorithms, systemic racism is hidden yet affects so many aspects of our lives. Yeshi drills down on one place it surfaces, with far-ranging consequences for Black communities: FICO and credit scores. These are the three-digit numbers that signal credit-worthiness to conventional lenders, determining whether you can buy a house, start a business, or finance an education. Here’s Yeshi on the creation of credit scores and why assumptions about tech must be challenged, even if intentions seem on the mark:

Data, health equity, and Covid-19
Yeshimabeit has worked on data and health outcomes since right after college. At age 22, she gathered data from 300 moms at the country’s biggest public hospital (in Miami) in order to understand why Black infant mortality rates are disproportionately so high. Fast forward to today: when Covid surfaced in the U.S. in March, she and Data 4 Black Lives went immediately to the data:

                '33': '''Designing for suicidal users: preventing suicide the modern way
Every month, over half a million people in the US make suicide-related searches on Google. The automated response that is supposed to stop them and save lives feels lifeless.

This needs to change now.
Image for post
Back in college, I was that 1 in 5 college students who suffer from anxiety and depression. Pressure from trying to get good grades, looking for jobs, relationships, and becoming an adult drowned me with worries (often innocuous ones now I look back).
One time in junior year, I had a surprisingly exhausting day — one of those days when you’ve already completely filled up your calendar, but new meetings and problems endlessly show up. That night, I lied in bed overtired yet wide awake from paranoia. After failing to fall asleep for almost 3 hours, I got up and Googled,
“how to die easily”
And this is what I saw.
Image for post
Image for post
Let me make myself clear. Yes, I was mildly depressed but I wasn’t seriously suicidal. I was triggered mostly by twisted frustration (exacerbated by lack of sleep), than by an actual suicide ideation.
But even to me “You’re not alone, confidential help is available for free. Call 1–800–273–8255” sounded very much aloof and merely political. It’s as if someone was crying out for help, and you’re just flicking a name card of a therapist without even looking in their eyes.
Thankfully, I scoffed at it and eventually fell asleep. But to this day, I can’t imagine how frivolous the “support” must look to those who are actually desperate to end their lives. It was a lazy mechanical response with a bland sincerity like water.
1. The Problem
I survived. I am at a much better place now, but I simply couldn’t forget the lifelessness of the response that’s meant to save lives. I went back to see if anything had changed.
Image for post
Search results for keywords related to suicide ideation. Clockwise from top-left: Google, Yahoo, Bing, and Facebook.
Unfortunately, they were still all variations of simply providing contact information of hotlines. The end-goal is to put a halt to suicidal thoughts and make users pick up their phone to call for further support. To reach this end-goal, users will have to
Perceive the information and feel the need for help — At this stage, most people are already trapped deep in their dark emotional chambers. They’ll be among the hardest to impress, and a phone number wouldn’t mean anything to them. (barrier)
Pick up the phone and dial — Physical constraint that just adds another step to the process. What if your phone is out of reach? (barrier)
Stay on hold to get connected to a counselor — You’ll be greeted by a scripted automated message. To me, this always felt wildly impersonal, and I’ve actually hung up a couple of times before reaching a real person. (barrier!)
These users weren’t even asking for help in the first place. They were asking for ways to kill themselves. Passively offering an option to get help will not work. Instead, We must present something personal and relatable so that they feel that people care and help is always out there.
2. Looking at the numbers
I used a couple of search analytics tool to understand the extent of this issue.
Google Trends — Determine relevant keywords and their trends.
Google trends can be used to determine popularity of keywords. It also provides Related Topics and Queries, which came in handy when determining relevance and accuracy of keywords.
For example, the first trend I analyzed was quite obviously “suicide”. However, Related Topics and Queries for this term indicated that the outcome was influenced by viral trends such as Suicide Squad or the Logan Paul incident.
To rule these misleading results out, I chose more specific sentences like “how to commit suicide”, but Related Queries were still affected by popular media references, mostly about celebrities tragically ending their lives.
So I decided to entirely get rid of the term suicide, and went for “How to kill myself”. Bullseye, all Related Queries were about mental disorders and suicidal thoughts.
Image for post
Top five Related Queries for “How to kill myself”
From this data, I retrieved ten most popular keywords that accurately represented suicidal searches. I combined these to plot a five-year trend for the ten keywords.
Image for post
Suicidal search trends from 2013 to 2018
Without a doubt, depressed and suicidal searches were rising at a steady and alarming rate.
Ahrefs Keywords Explorer (AKE) — Find more keywords and exact statistics.
AKE is a fantastic tool to access exact search metrics.
I first tested the metrics of 10 keywords I previously got from Google Trends. AKE showed that each of these keywords belonged to a broader parent topic such as ‘how to tie a noose’, ‘I hate my life’, and ‘kill me’. When I unfolded these parent topics, I got hundreds of child keywords that represented suicide and depression.
I then ran a combined analysis for all the related keywords.
Image for post
Image for post
The result was absolutely devastating: 611,000 suicidal searches per month just in the US (that’s more than the entire population of Wyoming). What’s worse, only 40,000 users clicked on the first link (Suicide Prevention Lifeline). Although this doesn’t really tell much about conversion, a 6% click rate to a top suicide-prevention link seemed low enough to think that there is a better way to help people on the verge of making life-threatening decisions.
Image for post
To sum up and visually represent the project, I created a word cloud consisting of popular suicidal keywords.
From a 2017 study, 89% of suicide attempt survivors said their actions were impulsive. 52% of the survivors said they would’ve reconsidered their actions had they received care and support.
Based on these chilling stats, it was evident that we cannot wait any longer to come up with something that would put brakes to impulsive suicide ideation, and guide people to reach out for help.
3. Inspiration
The first thing that popped into my head was an experimental suicide prevention project in Korea. There is a bridge in Seoul where people jump of almost every day to end their lives. One genius solution proposed by the city was to place banners with supportive quotes on the railings. Anyone who wants to jump over would have to read them.
Image for post

Signs on the railings. Left: “Try going for it” (Photo: Yes24); Right: “You must have been through a lot” — in a narrative of a wise old man. (Photo: Yonhap News)
Some of the quotes were by famous people, some were in narrative styles of close friends and family members such as “How are you doing buddy?”; “It’s a little cold out here today.”; “Did you eat anything yet?”
The city officials said “We didn’t want to barricade people. We wanted to turn their hearts around the right way.”
As you read the quotes and walk along the bridge, you will eventually reach an emergency phone booth where you can speak directly to a counsellor. From a UX design perspective, this was an ideal solution. The whole experience, from going up the bridge depressed to feeling supported and calling the hotline, was seamless.

Criticisms
One of the most important things about depression: Everyone has different problems, and an advice that works for one person might have an opposite effect for another.
Here are a couple of controversial phrases on the bridge.
“Why don’t you go down and grab a cup of coffee with a friend”: Intended to give some peace with a casual routine — Would be detrimental to someone who doesn’t have many friends, or who has financial problems and can’t afford a cup of coffee.
“This too shall pass. Think of it like a gust of wind”: Intended to tell people that problems are temporary and it gets better — Would be detrimental to people who suffer from incurable illness or insurmountable debt.
People were also concerned about the long-term effects and the extent of the project. The signs were indeed successful in faltering suicidal thoughts on top of that bridge. But it was unclear if people had ended up getting support afterwards. Without continuous therapy, suicide ideation can circle back at any time, and seeing the same quotes again might not be as effective as the first time. The experience was an instant painkiller, but not necessarily a cure to exterminate the virus.
Solution
Online search website would be a perfect platform to implement effective suicide prevention in which we persuade the users to get support. Needless to say, it will get more exposure than any other preventive methods. On top of that, with interactive and evolving content, we can recreate and enhance the seamless experience of the bridge project. Without any physical limitations, we can also present a much more personalized experience that targets individuals, solving chronic problems that many methods faced in the past.
4. Key Components
Image for post
Five main features are explained below.
Identifying causes for suicide ideation to understand users
This is the first step to a personalized content. Know your enemies — identifying the causes will help us sympathize with users more.
According to a research conducted by the Korean Ministry of Health and Welfare, the leading cause for suicide attempt was mental illness (31%), followed by relationships (23%), arguments (14.1%), financial problems (10.5%), and physical health (7.5%).
I wrote down as many causes as I could from research and experience. I sorted them into five very broad categories, so that all victims can relate to at least one of them.
Relationships (loss of loved ones, arguments…)
Achievements (academics, career…)
Society (gender inequality, sexual-identity, mid-life crisis…)
Body & Mind (physical and mental health, addiction, violence…)
Emotions (Feelings of guilt, regretful decisions…)
Conversational experience for interaction and engagement
The current automated interface feels impersonal because it is too uniform (besides the sterility of design).
An interface that reacts to users’ actions can give a sense of care and involvement. A sincere conversation, rather than a one-way display, would be much more effective in delivering a personalized message.
Universally effective quote to grab attention
To tone down suicidal thoughts on the first encounter, I needed a striking catchphrase that will at least temporarily hold back suicidal conviction and grab user’s attention.
The first quote focused on the fact that although death might seem like the best option, there will always be better ways with proper support.
“There’s always a better choice than taking your own life.”
This will also trigger curiosity — users will naturally want to stay engaged in the conversation to further explore the “better choice” mentioned in the quote.
The second quote actually came up as I was editing. It was inspired by lines from the original Deadpool comics (Special thanks to my colleague Cheongho for the suggestion).
In this particular scene, Deadpool saves a woman from jumping off a building using his iconic dark humor. When she comes down to the ground, she asks Deadpool to take her back home. Instead, Deadpool takes her to a counseling center and says,
“I’m smart enough to know I am dumb enough that I can’t help you. But they (pointing at the counseling center) can” — Wade Wilson, a.k.a. Deadpool.
This felt electric. I realized how inflated the first quote could sound. I (or the machine) am neither someone who properly understands people’s problems nor who can provide an answer. Search engine is simply a messenger that guides users to professionals who can actually solve their problems. With that, I thought the following quote would be much more appropriate.
“We are only a search engine, and cannot give you answers to your hardest questions. But we can help you get there.”
With a Socratic mindset of accepting the shortcomings, we can finally carve a path to professional help for the users, instead of senselessly providing unqualified advice. Accepting the imperfection can also make things look more friendly and approachable.
Personalized quotes to avoid misinterpretation
One big issue with the suicide prevention bridge in Korea was that the quotes weren’t always effective to everyone. We can avoid this by asking the users why they feel suicidal, and displaying different quotes depending on what the causes are.
Success stories to show that there is a better option than suicide
Even the same words will be more powerful when it comes from people who share similar experiences. Upon reading real life stories that users can relate to, they will want to know more about ways to get support and live through their tragedies just as the survivors did.
Image for post
www.livethroughthis.org is a great resource for people with depression or suicide ideation. They have inspirational stories from people who survived suicide attempt.
5. Design
Respecting Google’s design DNA
This is a redesign, not a new service that I am launching. One principle I value the most when redesigning an existing interface is respecting the original design principles. Design is never just about making it look pretty. Design is a manifestation of a company’s philosophy and core-values based on years of research and testing.
My initial plan was to have a full-screen display for a more immersive experience. However, I was well aware of Google’s cardview-like display for themed content and decided to be consistent with that. From Chrome’s developer tool, I studied the grid system of the search interface and simulated it in Sketch.
Image for post
Simulating Google’s search interface grid system on Sketch
I also chose the original typeface used in Google’s search interface (Roboto). However, I customized font size and weight hoping that such small variations wouldn’t be too distracting.
Image for post
I selected symbols and icons from Google Material Design library to further pursue design consistency.
Image for post
Icons to represent 5 basis of suicidal thoughts.
“Blue is the warmest color”
Just like the movie title (watch it if you want to cry your heart out), blue gives relaxation and is the most used color in mental therapy. Blue can reduce tension throughout the body and help people with anxiety and depression.
Considering our audience, I didn’t want to use shades of blue that were too aggressive. I chose a low saturated, dreamy but not hazy colors (summer sky in San Francisco) to soothe suicide ideation victims.

Color pallette for icons and fonts
For buttons with emphasis, I used a color with slightly more saturation for better contrast.

Banner with color emphasis
6. Overall experience
Image for post
3-step sequence of the overall experience
Greetings
This is the first interface users will face and interact with upon a suicide-related search.
Image for post
On the top will be a quote that grabs all users’ attention (1. There’s always a better choice…OR 2. We are only a search engine…), followed by a friendly question that asks to choose one of five main causes for suicidal thoughts. These are five very broad and vague categories, and detailed examples of each will slide up from the bottom when users hover on the icons. On the bottom-right, there will be a contact information so anyone can call for support at any time.
Icebreakers
Image for post
Within the chosen category, users will be asked to narrow down and specify their issues. If they don’t think they chose the right category, they can always go back to the beginning. If users don’t see a relatable case anywhere, they can select the final option “No, but I want to tell you more”. This will take them to a text-input interface where they can freely write about their issues, since I believe sharing issues out loud can always relieve stress to a certain extent.
Follow-up
Image for post
Based on the user’s choice in the previous step, a fully personalized content will be displayed with an inspirational quote and a survivor’s story. The experience will end with an emphasized contact information of suicide hotline.
(For users who selected “No, but I want to tell you more” option in the previous step, a safer and more general quote and story will be displayed instead.)
Demonstration
John, a college student, has failed all his exams and lost his scholarship. He can no longer pursue his education. Out of hope, John has had suicidal thoughts for almost a month. He finally thinks that nothing will ever get better, and looked up for ways to kill himself on Google.

7. Closing up and future plans
I wanted to design an automated response that was sincere and caring. Machines (at least for now) are not as sincere as humans. It was very important to accept this as it allowed me to focus on what machines are superior at — processing variables and displaying dynamic content. And when capabilities of machines and humans are properly utilized together, we can transcend physical limitations of previous suicide prevention methods and deliver sincereness to infinite number of people.
As a humble middleman between the dark side and the light, the new interface will guide hundreds of thousands of suicide ideation victims to the best bet we have — human support.
For the past couple of months, I gained knowledge on suicide simply from online resources. The project is nowhere near perfect, and I wouldn’t be surprised to find numerous flaws and fallacies.
But I think this is a good starting point. I would love to work closely with experts in psychology, design, HCI or any relevant field to talk about the shortcomings, discuss possible improvements, and hopefully save more lives.
Let’s talk!
